[1000344700080] |Throughout the 1960s and 70's, the unit received and flew different aircraft with which to fly its mission.
[1000344700090] |In 1987, the unit prepared to move to its present home at ⌊>Stewart Air National Guard Base>⌋.
[1000344700100] |On May 1, 1984, it was redesignated the 105th Military Airlift Group.
[1000344700110] |In July 1985 the unit made the largest leap, in terms of size, of aircraft possible.
[1000344700120] |The unit changed from flying the ⌊>O-2A Skymaster>⌋ to the ⌊>C-5A Galaxy>⌋.
[1000344700130] |Over the years it has flown numerous humanitarian missions as well as supporting operations for the military.
[1000344700140] |During the ⌊>Hurricane Katrina>⌋ relief operations, 105th flew the 12 missions delivering about 1.5 million pounds of cargo and 400 passengers in support of the relief effort.

[1000344800010] |The ⌊∗105th Armored Division∗⌋ is a military formation of the ⌊>Korean People's Army>⌋.
[1000344800020] |It was North Korea's first armored unit and took part in the ⌊>Korean War>⌋.

[1000344800030] |⌊=Formation and structure¦2=⌋
[1000344800040] |The division was established in October 1948 as the "105th Armored Battalion" and increased to regimental strength in May 1949.
[1000344800050] |By June 1950, the "105th Armored Regiment" had become the ⌊∗105th Armored Brigade∗⌋ with a strength of 6,000 men and 120 ⌊>T-34 tanks>⌋.
[1000344800060] |Its equipment-tanks, weapons, and vehicles-was Russian-made.

[1000344800070] |The brigade had three tank regiments - the ⌊>107th>⌋, the ⌊>109th>⌋ and ⌊>203rd>⌋ - and a mechanized infantry regiment, the ⌊>206th>⌋.
[1000344800080] |The ⌊∗83d Motorized Regiment∗⌋ was also part of the division during the Korean War. .

[1000344800090] |Each tank regiment had three medium tank battalions, each having 13 tanks.
[1000344800100] |Each tank battalion had three tank companies with 4 tanks to a company.
[1000344800110] |Tank crews consisted of five men.
[1000344800120] |Battalion, regimental, and division tank commanders each had a personal tank.
[1000344800130] |The mechanised infantry regiment had a strength of about 2,500 men.

[1000344800140] |The ⌊∗105th Armored Brigade∗⌋ was ⌊/raised to division status/⌋ in Seoul at the end of June 1950 before it crossed the ⌊>Han River>⌋ to continue the attack southward.

[1000344800150] |⌊=Korean War¦2=⌋
[1000344800160] |During the Korean War, it was part of the North Korean advance from ⌊>Seoul>⌋ to ⌊>Taejon>⌋ and subsequent ⌊>Battle of Pusan Perimeter>⌋ between August and September 1950.

[1000344800170] |At the end of October and the first week of November 1950, the ⌊∗105th Armored Division∗⌋, partly reconstituted since the ⌊>Naktong>⌋ battles, was committed to help the ⌊>Chinese>⌋ and did so with tank fire in a few instances, but it played a negligible role in the fighting.
[1000344800180] |The U.S. ⌊>Fifth Air Force>⌋ destroyed most of its tanks back of the battle front.
[1000344800190] |On November 7, for instance, U.N. aircraft reportedly destroyed 6 tanks, 3 armored cars, and 45 vehicles in ⌊>Pakchon>⌋ and the area eastward.

[1000345000020] |It was part of a wave of new infantry divisions formed in the spring of 1915.
[1000345000030] |The division was disbanded in 1919 during the demobilization of the German Army after World War I.

[1000345000040] |The division was formed primarily from the excess infantry regiments of existing divisions which were being ⌊>triangularized>⌋.
[1000345000050] |The division's 209th Infantry Brigade was formerly the 69th Infantry Brigade of the ⌊>36th Infantry Division>⌋, and came to the division with the 129th Infantry Regiment.

[1000345000130] |Elements of the division were detached and sent to Bulgaria during this period.
[1000345000140] |The division was sent back to Galicia in June in response to the Russian ⌊>Brusilov Offensive>⌋.
[1000345000150] |In September, the division went to Latvia, and fought near ⌊>Riga>⌋ and Jakobstadt (now ⌊>Jēkabpils>⌋).
[1000345000160] |At the end of October 1917, the division was sent to the ⌊>Western Front>⌋, entering the line in the German "Siegfried" position.
[1000345000170] |It fought in the tank ⌊>Battle of Cambrai>⌋ in November 1917 and in the German counterattack in December.
[1000345000180] |In April 1918, the division participated in the German ⌊>Spring Offensive>⌋, fighting in the ⌊>First Battle of the Somme (1918)>⌋, also known as the Second Battle of the Somme (to distinguish it from the 1916 battle).
[1000345000190] |It remained in the Somme salient and fought against various Allied counteroffensives.
[1000345000200] |The division moved to the St. Mihiel salient in September and then occupied the line in the ⌊>Woëvre>⌋ region.
[1000345000210] |In October, it met the Allied ⌊>Meuse-Argonne Offensive>⌋.
[1000345000220] |The division remained in the line until the end of the war.
[1000345000230] |Allied intelligence rated the division as third class.

[1000345000240] |⌊=Late-war order of battle¦2=⌋
[1000345000250] |The division underwent relatively few organizational changes over the course of the war.
[1000345000260] |The 122nd Füsilier Regiment, a Württemberg unit, was replaced by the Prussian 400th Infantry Regiment.
[1000345000270] |Cavalry was reduced, artillery and signals commands were formed, and combat engineer support was expanded to a full pioneer battalion.

[1000345100000] |⌊δ105th Medium Battery, Royal Australian Artilleryδ⌋
[1000345100010] |The ⌊∗105th Medium Battery∗⌋ is a unit of the ⌊>Royal Regiment of Australian Artillery>⌋ that can trace its history back to March 1916 when it was raised as 105th Howitzer Battery in Egypt.

[1000345100020] |The Battery is based at Gallipoli Barracks, ⌊>Enoggera, Queensland>⌋, as a full-time, regular army unit and is one of three batteries that make up the ⌊>1st Field Regiment>⌋, part of ⌊>7 Brigade>⌋.

[1000345100030] |⌊=History¦2=⌋
[1000345100040] |The 105th Howitzer Battery was raised in March 1916 in Egypt as a part of the 22nd Howitzer Brigade, following a decision to equip each infantry division with a Howitzer Brigade, and shortly thereafter embarked for ⌊>Marseilles>⌋, ⌊>France>⌋.

[1000345100050] |⌊=World War I¦3=⌋
[1000345100060] |By 11 May 1916, the Battery joined ⌊>13th>⌋, 14th and 15th Batteries at ⌊>Fleurbiax>⌋, France (near ⌊>Armentieres>⌋) to form 5th Field Brigade Australian Field Artillery of 2nd Division Artillery, after a reorganisation of the artillery saw each field brigade having 12 x 18 pounders and 4 x ⌊λ4.5-inch (110 mm)¦4.5¦in¦mm¦sing=on¦Convertλ⌋ howitzers.
[1000345100070] |The Howitzer Brigades then became Field Artillery Brigades also, seeing the 105th Howitzer Battery become the 105th Field Artillery (Howitzer) Battery.

[1000345100080] |In January 1917, batteries were increased in size from four to six guns each in order to economise on battery and brigade commanders.

[1000345100090] |The Battery was disbanded following cessation of hostilities on 30 March 1919.

[1000345100100] |⌊=1921 to 1940¦3=⌋
[1000345100110] |Following a restructure of the ⌊>Citizen's Army>⌋, based on the framework of the ⌊>1st AIF>⌋, in 1921, the 105th Field (Howitzer) Battery was re-raised, along with the rest of the 5th Field Regiment, except for 15th Battery, which wasn't re-raised until 1938.
[1000345100120] |The Battery was based at Gona Barracks at ⌊>Kelvin Grove, Queensland>⌋ at this time.

[1000345100130] |During the ensuing years prior to ⌊>World War II>⌋, the Battery conducted several training camps around Brisbane.
[1000345100140] |The Battery embarked on their first annual training camp, held on the southern shores of the ⌊>Brisbane River>⌋ at ⌊>Lytton>⌋ in 1927.

[1000345100150] |During 1930, two training camps were conducted.
[1000345100160] |The first commenced on 4 April at Enoggera, with the second, commencing on 30 June, being conducted at Lytton.
[1000345100170] |A training camp during March 1931 was conducted at Bellevue Station, near ⌊>Ipswich>⌋.
[1000345100180] |At this time, the Battery was still using horses for transportation of personnel and its guns.

[1000345100190] |A new artillery range was opened by Assistant Minister for Defence Mr J. Francis in September 1934 at Mound Walker (near ⌊>Rosewood>⌋).
[1000345100200] |The Battery trekked ⌊λ50 miles (80 km)¦50¦mi¦km¦Convertλ⌋ to attend the opening of the new range, as well as conduct a joint exercise with the ⌊>111th Battery>⌋.
[1000345100210] |This exercise was held annually until 1939, when the Caloundra Range was established on a beach ⌊λ64 miles (103 km)¦64¦mi¦km¦Convertλ⌋ to the north of Brisbane.

[1000345100220] |During the 1937 exercises, cars and utilities were used for transportation by Battery staff, with other Battery personnel utilising horses.
[1000345100230] |The introduction of Fordson Gun Tractors in 1938 saw the Battery's guns being towed by the tractors, with the staff reverting to riding horses.
[1000345100240] |The Battery was fully mechanised from November 1939.

[1000345100250] |The Battery was again disbanded in December 1940, with members of the 5th Field Regiment amalgamating to form the newly raised 2nd/5th Field Regiment.
[1000345100260] |This unit was later re-designated 2nd/1st Anti Tank Regiment.

[1000345100270] |⌊=1955 to present¦3=⌋
[1000345100280] |The Battery was re-raised on ⌊>1 July>⌋ ⌊>1955>⌋ as an independent battery of 1st Field Regiment at ⌊>Holsworthy Barracks>⌋.
[1000345100290] |Shortly thereafter, the Battery was deployed on a tour of ⌊>Malaya>⌋, lasting from September 1955 to June 1957.

[1000345100300] |The Battery remained as a unit of the 1st Field Regiment until 1960, when the Battery moved to ⌊>Sanananda Barracks>⌋, ⌊>Wacol>⌋ to become a founding member of ⌊>4th Field Regiment>⌋.

[1000345100310] |⌊=Vietnam¦4=⌋
[1000345100320] |The Battery was involved in two tours of Vietnam.
[1000345100330] |The first from ⌊>14 September>⌋ ⌊>1965>⌋ to October 1966.
[1000345100340] |It was during this tour, on ⌊>18 August>⌋ ⌊>1966>⌋, that the Battery was involved in the ⌊>Battle of Long Tan>⌋.

[1000345100350] |The second and last tour of Vietnam lasted from February 1969 to March 1970.

[1000345100360] |In 1976, the Battery detached from the 4th Field Regiment and moved to its current home at Gallipoli Barracks, Enoggera to join 1st Field Regiment.

[1000345300040] |The 105th was raised mainly in the counties of ⌊>Jefferson>⌋, ⌊>Clarion>⌋, and ⌊>Clearfield>⌋.
[1000345300050] |It was organized at ⌊>Pittsburgh>⌋ in September and October 1861, and mustered into the U. S. service for a three-year term.
[1000345300060] |Among the early recruits was future ⌊>United States Congress>⌋man ⌊>Albert C. Thompson>⌋.

[1000345300070] |The regiment was ordered to ⌊>Washington>⌋ in October and assigned to the 1st Brigade, 1st Division, ⌊>III Corps>⌋, in Camp Jameson (on the farm of ⌊>American Revolution>⌋ patriot ⌊>George Mason>⌋), near ⌊>Alexandria>⌋.

[1000345300080] |Leaving camp on ⌊>March 17>⌋, ⌊>1862>⌋, the regiment took part in the ⌊>siege of Yorktown>⌋ and the battles of ⌊>Williamsburg>⌋ and ⌊>Fair Oaks>⌋.
[1000345300090] |In the latter engagement, the troops fought like veterans, holding their position unsupported until nearly surrounded.
[1000345300100] |Three companies were on special duty at the opening of the action and, being unable to reach the regiment in its exposed position, fought with the 57th Pennsylvania.
[1000345300110] |After a month spent on picket duty, the 105th was again in action at ⌊>Glendale>⌋ and ⌊>Malvern Hill>⌋, and, by the time it reached Harrison's Landing, the ranks were so reduced by wounds and sickness that less than 100 men were fit for active duty.

[1000345300120] |While posted along the railroad between ⌊>Manassas>⌋ and ⌊>Warrenton Junction>⌋, companies B, G and H were captured by the Confederates.
[1000345300130] |The 1st and Hooker's divisions were engaged at Bristoe Station on ⌊>August 29>⌋.
[1000345300140] |The following day, the entire army was in action at ⌊>Second Bull Run>⌋, where once more the gallant work of the 105th resulted in significant losses.
[1000345300150] |The regiment was specially complimented by Maj. Gen. ⌊>Philip Kearny>⌋ for its gallantry.
[1000345300160] |September and October were spent at Washington.
[1000345300170] |The command left the nation's capital on ⌊>October 28>⌋, and, after some scouting near ⌊>Leesburg>⌋, arrived at ⌊>Falmouth>⌋ on ⌊>November 24>⌋.
[1000345300180] |The 105th's next battle was at ⌊>Fredericksburg>⌋, after which it spent the winter in camp near Brandy Station.

[1000345300200] |At the ⌊>Battle of Chancellorsville>⌋ in May 1863, the troops were warmly engaged, and many won the Kearny Medal of Honor (the ⌊>Kearny Cross>⌋).
[1000345300210] |The first two weeks of June were spent at Banks Ford, and then the troops started northward.
[1000345300220] |At the ⌊>Battle of Gettysburg>⌋, the regiment lost many men, and, after the return to Virginia, engagements followed at Auburn, Kelly's Ford, and Locust Grove in the ⌊>Mine Run campaign>⌋ late in November.
