[1000299000110] |On ⌊>19 August>⌋ ⌊>1942>⌋, its first commander, Major General ⌊>William C. Lee>⌋, promised his new recruits that the 101⌊^st^⌋ had "no history but had a rendezvous with destiny."

[1000299000250] |As part of this formation, the division took part in ⌊>Operation Market Garden>⌋.

[1000299000260] |During the ⌊>Battle of the Bulge>⌋ the 101⌊^st^⌋, as one of the few forces available to contain the German advance, was rushed forward by truck to defend the vital road junction of ⌊>Bastogne>⌋.

[1000299000690] |⌊=Reactivation¦3=⌋
[1000299000700] |The 101⌊^st^⌋ Airborne Division was reactivated as a training unit at ⌊>Camp Breckinridge, Kentucky>⌋, in 1948 and again in 1950.
[1000299000710] |It was reactivated again in 1954 at ⌊>Fort Jackson>⌋, ⌊>South Carolina>⌋, and in March 1956, the 101⌊^st^⌋ was transferred, less personnel and equipment, to ⌊>Fort Campbell, Kentucky>⌋, to be reorganized as a combat division.
[1000299000720] |The 101st was reactivated as a "pentomic" division with five battle groups in place of its World War II structure that featured regiments and battalions.
[1000299000730] |The reorganization was in place by late April 1957 and the division's battle groups were:

[1000299000740] |⌊•⌊#2d Airborne Battle Group, 187th Infantry#⌋
[1000299000750] |⌊#1st Airborne Battle Group, 327th Infantry#⌋
[1000299000760] |⌊#1st Airborne Battle Group, 501st Infantry#⌋
[1000299000770] |⌊#1st Airborne Battle Group, 502nd Infantry#⌋
[1000299000780] |⌊#1st Airborne Battle Group, 506th Infantry#⌋•⌋

[1000299000790] |Division artillery consisted of the following units:

[1000299000800] |⌊•⌊#Battery D, 319th Artillery (Abn)#⌋
[1000299000810] |⌊#Battery E, 319th Artillery (Abn)#⌋
[1000299000820] |⌊#Battery A, 321st Artillery (Abn)#⌋
[1000299000830] |⌊#Battery B, 321st Artillery (Abn)#⌋
[1000299000840] |⌊#Battery C, 321st Artillery (Abn)#⌋
[1000299000850] |⌊#Battery A, 377th Artillery (Abn)#⌋•⌋

[1000299000860] |Other supporting units were also assigned.

[1000299000870] |⌊=Civil rights¦3=⌋
[1000299000880] |From September through November 1957 elements of the division's 1st Airborne Battle Group, 327th Infantry (bearing the lineage of the old Company A, 327th Glider Infantry Regiment) were deployed to ⌊>Little Rock>⌋, ⌊>Arkansas>⌋, by President ⌊>Dwight D. Eisenhower>⌋ to enforce Federal court orders during the ⌊>Little Rock Crisis>⌋.

[1000299000890] |⌊=Vietnam War¦3=⌋
[1000299000900] |In the mid-1960s, the 1⌊^st^⌋ Brigade and support troops were deployed to the ⌊>Republic of Vietnam>⌋, followed by the rest of the division in late 1967.
[1000299000910] |In almost seven years of combat in Vietnam, elements of the 101⌊^st^⌋ participated in 15 campaigns.
[1000299000920] |Notable among these were the ⌊>Battle of Hamburger Hill>⌋ in 1969 and ⌊>Firebase Ripcord>⌋ in 1970.
[1000299000930] |The 101st was deployed in the northern I Corps region operating against the ⌊>Vietnam People's Army>⌋ (NVA) infiltration routes through ⌊>Laos>⌋ and the ⌊>A Shau Valley>⌋.
[1000299000940] |Elements of the division supported the ⌊>ARVN>⌋ ⌊>Operation Lam Son 719>⌋, the invasion of southern Laos, in 1971, but only aviation units actually entered Laos.
[1000299000950] |In the seven years that all or part of the division served in Vietnam it suffered 4,011 Killed in Action and 18,259 Wounded in Action.

[1000299000960] |It has been said that most North Vietnamese had never seen a bald eagle, so they called the 101st soldiers "Chicken Men" or "Rooster Men."
[1000299000970] |Viet Cong commanders would regularly include in their briefings that they were to avoid confrontation with the "Chicken Men" at all costs, as they were sure to lose.
[1000299000980] |Supposedly this remained a source of fierce pride among veterans who served in Vietnam under the 101st.

[1000299000990] |Such claims must be balanced against the reality of combat losses.
[1000299001000] |Casualties for the 101st in Viet Nam were twice those suffered in World War II, and its total number of Killed in Action (4,022) was the third highest of all U.S. Army ground units, behind the 1st Cavalry Division (5,464) and the 25th Infantry Division (4,561).
[1000299001010] |Had the entire division arrived in 1965, as did the 1st Cav and 25th, its total casualties would have undoubtedly been even higher.

[1000299001020] |⌊=Post-Vietnam¦3=⌋
[1000299001030] |In 1968, the 101⌊^st^⌋ took on the structure and equipment of an airmobile division.
[1000299001040] |Following its return from Vietnam, the division was rebuilt with one brigade (3d) and supporting elements on jump status, using the assets of what had been the 173rd Airborne Brigade.
[1000299001050] |The remaining two brigades and supporting units were organized as airmobile.
[1000299001060] |With the exception of certain specialized units, such as the pathfinders and parachute riggers, in early 1974 the Army terminated jump status for the division.
[1000299001070] |Concurrently the 101st introduced the Airmobile Badge (renamed later that year as the ⌊>Air Assault Badge>⌋), the design of which was based on the Glider Badge of World War II.
[1000299001080] |Initially the badge was only authorized for wear while assigned to the division, but in 1978 the Army authorized it for service-wide wear.
[1000299001090] |Soldiers continued to wear the garrison cap with glider patch, bloused boots, and the cloth wing oval behind their wings, as had division paratroopers before them.
[1000299001100] |The division also was authorized to wear a full color (white eagle) shoulder patch insignia instead of the subdued green eagle shoulder patch that was worn as a combat patch by soldiers who fought with the 101st in Vietnam, a distinction shared with the 1st and 5th Infantry divisions.

[1000299001110] |Tragedy struck the division on ⌊>12 December>⌋ ⌊>1985>⌋.
[1000299001120] |A civilian aircraft, ⌊>Arrow Air Flight 1285>⌋, chartered to transport some of the division from peacekeeping duty with the Multinational Force Observers on the ⌊>Sinai Peninsula>⌋ to Kentucky, crashed near ⌊>Gander, Newfoundland>⌋.
[1000299001130] |All eight air crew members and 248 US servicemen died, most were from the 3d Battalion, 502d Infantry.
[1000299001140] |The crash was the worst in Canadian aviation history.
[1000299001150] |President Ronald Reagan and his wife Nancy travelled to Fort Campbell to comfort grieving family members.
[1000299001160] |On ⌊>March 8>⌋, ⌊>1988>⌋, two U.S. Army helicopters collided in Fort Campbell, Kentucky, killing 17 servicemen.

[1000299001170] |⌊=Persian Gulf War¦3=⌋
[1000299001180] |In January 1991, the 101⌊^st^⌋ once again had its "Rendezvous with Destiny" in ⌊>Iraq>⌋ during the combat air assault into enemy territory.
[1000299001190] |The 101⌊^st^⌋ sustained no soldiers killed in action during the 100-hour war and captured thousands of enemy prisoners of war.
[1000299001200] |General ⌊>Richard A. Cody>⌋, then lieutenant colonel, commander of the 1st Battalion, 101st Aviation Regiment, fired the first shots of the war from his ⌊>AH-64 Apache>⌋.

[1000299001210] |The division has supported humanitarian relief efforts in ⌊>Rwanda>⌋ and ⌊>Somalia>⌋, then later supplied peacekeepers to ⌊>Haiti>⌋ and ⌊>Bosnia>⌋.

[1000299001220] |⌊=Operation Enduring Freedom¦3=⌋
[1000299001230] |The 101st Airborne Division (Air Assault) was the first conventional unit to deploy in support of the American War on Terrorism.
[1000299001240] |The 2d Brigade, "Strike", built around the 502d Infantry, was largely deployed to Kosovo on peacekeeping operations, with some elements of 3/502 deploying after 9/11 as a security element in the CENTCOM AOR with the Fort Campbell-based 5th Special Forces Group.
[1000299001250] |The Division quickly deployed its 3d Brigade, the 187th Infantry's "⌊/Rakkasans/⌋" as the first conventional unit to fight as part of Operation Enduring Freedom.
[1000299001260] |After an intense period of combat in rugged Shoh-I-Khot Mountains of eastern Afghanistan during ⌊>Operation Anaconda>⌋ with elements of the 10th Mountain Division, the ⌊/Rakkasans/⌋ redeployed to Fort Campbell only to find the 101st awaiting another deployment order.

[1000299001270] |⌊=Operation Iraqi Freedom¦3=⌋
[1000299001280] |In 2003, Major General ⌊>David H. Petraeus>⌋ ("Eagle 6") led the Screaming Eagles to war during the ⌊>2003 invasion of Iraq>⌋ (⌊>Operation Iraqi Freedom>⌋).
[1000299001290] |General Petraeus led the division into Iraq saying, "Guidons, Guidons.
[1000299001300] |This is Eagle 6.
[1000299001310] |The 101st Airborne Division's next Rendezvous with Destiny is North to Baghdad.
[1000299001320] |Op-Ord Desert Eagle 2 is now in effect.
[1000299001330] |Godspeed.
[1000299001340] |Air Assault.
[1000299001350] |Out."
[1000299001360] |The division was in ⌊>V Corps>⌋, providing support to the ⌊>3d Infantry Division>⌋ by clearing Iraqi strongpoints which that division had bypassed.
[1000299001370] |The Division then went on to a tour of duty as part of the occupation forces of Iraq, using the city of ⌊>Mosul>⌋ as their primary base of operations.
[1000299001380] |1st and 2d Battalion, 327th Infantry Regiment (1st Brigade) oversaw the remote airfield ⌊>Qayarrah West>⌋ 30 miles south of Mosul.
[1000299001390] |The 502d Infantry Regiment (2d Brigade) and 3d Battalion, 327th Infantry Regiment were responsible for Mosul itself while the 187th Infantry Regiment (3d Brigade) controlled ⌊>Tal Afar>⌋ just north of Mosul.

[1000299001400] |Once replaced by the first operational ⌊>Stryker>⌋ Brigade, the 101st was withdrawn in early 2004 for rest and refit.
[1000299001410] |As part of the Army's modular transformation, the existing infantry brigades, artillery brigade, and aviation brigades were transformed.
[1000299001420] |The Army also activated the 4th ⌊>Brigade Combat Team>⌋, which includes the 1st and 2nd Battalions, 506th Infantry Regiment ("Currahee") and subordinate units.
[1000299001430] |Both battalions were part of the 101st in Vietnam but saw their colors inactivated during an Army-wide reflagging of combat battalions in the 1980s, with 1-506th INF resurfacing in Korea, along with 1-503d INF and 2-503d INF (the latter later inactivated), as Air Assault units within the 2d Infantry Division.
[1000299001440] |The colors of the 506th have returned to the 101st and 1-503d and 2-503d are parachute infantry battalions of the 173d Airborne Brigade in Italy, just as they were when the 173d was in Viet Nam.

[1000299001450] |The reconfiguration of 101st formed seven major units in the division (four infantry BCTs, two combat aviation brigades (CABs), and one sustainment brigade), making it the largest formation currently in the U.S. Army.

[1000299001460] |As of December 2007, 143 members of the Division have died while on service in Iraq.

[1000299001470] |⌊=Second deployment to Iraq¦3=⌋
[1000299001480] |The division's second deployment to Iraq began in the late summer of 2005.
[1000299001490] |The division headquarters replaced the ⌊>42d Infantry Division>⌋, which had been directing security operations as the headquarters for Task Force Liberty.
[1000299001500] |Renamed Task Force Band of Brothers, the 101st assumed responsibility on ⌊>1 November>⌋ ⌊>2005>⌋ for four provinces in north central Iraq: Salah ad Din, Kirkuk, Diyala and As Sulymaniyah.
[1000299001510] |On ⌊>30 December>⌋ ⌊>2005>⌋, Task Force Band of Brothers also assumed responsibility for training Iraqi security forces and conducting security operations in Ninevah and Dahuk provinces as the headquarters for Task Force Freedom was disestablished.

[1000299001520] |During the second deployment, 2d and 4th Brigades of the 101st Airborne Division were assigned to conduct security operations under the command of Task Force Baghdad, led initially by ⌊>3d Infantry Division>⌋, which was replaced by ⌊>4th Infantry Division>⌋.
[1000299001530] |The 1st Battalion of the 506th Infantry (4th Brigade) was separated from the division and served with the Marines in Ramadi, in the Al Anbar province.
[1000299001540] |3d Brigade was assigned to ⌊>Salah ad Din>⌋ and ⌊>Bayji>⌋ sectors and 1st Brigade was assigned to the overall ⌊>Kirkuk>⌋ province which included ⌊>Hawijah>⌋, one of the deadliest cities in Iraq.

[1000299001550] |⌊>Task Force Band of Brothers>⌋' primary mission during its second deployment to Iraq was the training of Iraqi security forces.
[1000299001560] |When the 101st returned to Iraq, there were no Iraqi units capable of assuming the lead for operations against Iraqi and foreign terrorists.
[1000299001570] |As the division concluded its tour, 33 battalions were in the lead for security in assigned areas, and two of four Iraq divisions in northern Iraq were commanding and controlling subordinate units.

[1000299001580] |Simultaneously with training Iraqi Soldiers and their leaders, 101st Soldiers conducted numerous security operations against terrorist cells operating in the division's assigned, six-province area of operations.
[1000299001590] |⌊>Operation Swarmer>⌋ was the largest air assault operation conducted in Iraq since ⌊>22 April>⌋ ⌊>2003>⌋.
[1000299001600] |1st Brigade conducted ⌊>Operation Scorpion>⌋ with Iraqi units near Kirkuk.

[1000299001610] |Developing other aspects of Iraqi society also figured in 101st operations in Iraq.
[1000299001620] |Division commander ⌊>Major General>⌋ ⌊>Thomas Turner>⌋ hosted the first governors' conference for the six provinces in the division's area of operations, as well as the neighboring province of Erbil.
[1000299001630] |Numerous civil affairs operations were directed by the division, including the construction and renovation of schools, clinics, police stations, and other important landmarks in civilian communities from Turkey to Baghdad and from the Syrian border to the Iranian border.

[1000299001640] |⌊=Accusations of misconduct in Iraq¦2=⌋
[1000299001650] |On ⌊>19 June>⌋ ⌊>2006>⌋, the US military announced that three soldiers of the 3d Brigade Combat Team, 101st Airborne Division, ⌊>Private First Class>⌋ ⌊>Corey R.

[1000299001660] |On ⌊>21 June>⌋ a fourth soldier was charged, but none were convicted.

[1000299001670] |In July 2006, five troopers were charged in connection with the rape and murder of 14 year old Iraqi girl ⌊>Abeer Qasim>⌋, and the murder of three of her family members, including a 5-year-old girl.
[1000299001680] |The incident took place in ⌊>Mahmoudiya>⌋, south of Baghdad.
[1000299001690] |Previously, an arrest in the case was also made in ⌊>June>⌋ of 2006 when former trooper ⌊>Steven D. Green>⌋ was apprehended in ⌊>North Carolina>⌋.
[1000299001700] |On ⌊>17 November>⌋ ⌊>2006>⌋ Specialist James Barker was sentenced to life in prison for the incident.
[1000299001710] |Friday ⌊>23 February>⌋ ⌊>2007>⌋ saw the Sergeant, two specialists and two privates convicted with lengthy sentences.

[1000299001720] |⌊=Third deployment to Iraq¦3=⌋
[1000299001730] |The 1st Brigade Combat Team of the 101st is currently deployed in Iraq, in the Salah ad Din Province, northeast of Baghdad.
[1000299001740] |The 2d Brigade Combat Team is currently deployed in Baghdad, and the 3d Brigade Combat Team is currently deployed in the Southern belt region southwest of Baghdad.

[1000299001750] |⌊=General information¦2=⌋
[1000299001760] |The most recent change of command within the division took place on ⌊>10 November>⌋ ⌊>2006>⌋.
[1000299001770] |During this change of command, MG Jeff Schloesser took command of the 101st from the division's previous commander, now-LTG Tom Turner.

[1000299500020] |⌊=The beginning¦2=⌋
[1000299500030] |The Regiment was first formed in 1778 after 6 grenadier companies (two companies each from the three battalions of the ⌊>Bombay Army>⌋) were combined to form a composite battalion.
[1000299500040] |The Regiment took part in the ⌊>First Mahratta War>⌋ against the ⌊>Mahratta Empire>⌋ and fought in a number of engagements against them, including the ⌊>Battle of Talegoan>⌋ where they fought with distinction.
[1000299500050] |As a consequence of the unit's impressive performances it was formally created into a permanent unit as the ⌊∗8th Regiment of Bombay Sepoys∗⌋.

[1000299500060] |In 1783 the regiment's title was altered to become the ⌊∗8th Grenadier Regiment of Bombay Sepoys∗⌋, and was also known simply as the ⌊∗Bombay Grenadiers∗⌋.
[1000299500070] |The Regiment claimed that it was the oldest ⌊>grenadier>⌋ regiment in the ⌊>British Empire>⌋; the ⌊>British Army>⌋ ⌊>Grenadier Guards>⌋ did not gain its Grenadier title until 1815 after its actions against the French grenadiers at the ⌊>Battle of Waterloo>⌋.

[1000299500080] |Meanwhile, the Regiment took part in the numerous ⌊>Mysore Wars>⌋.
[1000299500090] |In 1783 the Regiment was part of the ⌊>Mangalore>⌋ garrison that was besieged by the ⌊>Tipu Sultan>⌋ and his vastly numerically superior ⌊>Mysore>⌋ forces.
[1000299500100] |The British-Indian garrison distinguished itself during the siege of Mangalore, holding out for 9 months before they eventually negotiated a settlement that permitted the garrison to have safe passage to rejoin British forces.
[1000299500110] |For the Regiment's actions during the siege it gained, despite it being a defeat, the ⌊>Battle Honour>⌋ "Mangalore".
[1000299500120] |The Regiment later gained the ⌊>White Horse of Hanover>⌋ -- the symbol of ⌊>King George III>⌋ and his ⌊>Royal House>⌋ -- as its badge.
[1000299500130] |The last of the Mysore wars that the regiment took part in, took place between 1789-1792 and the Regiment won the Honour "Mysore" for its involvemnent.

[1000299500140] |In 1798 the Regiment became the 1st Battalion upon the raising of a 2nd Battalion.
[1000299500150] |The regiment's title was also changed to the ⌊∗1st Grenadier Regiment of Bombay Native Infantry∗⌋.
[1000299500160] |The 2nd Battalion was later separated from the 1st Grenadiers to become a regiment itself -- the 2nd Grenadier Regiment of Bombay Native Infantry (later the ⌊>102nd King Edward's Own Grenadiers>⌋) -- in 1824.
[1000299500170] |In December 1825 the ⌊>Siege of Bharatpur>⌋ began, which the 1st Grenadiers took part in; the siege did not conclude until ⌊>18 January>⌋ ⌊>1826>⌋ with the capture of ⌊>Bharatpur>⌋ by British forces.
[1000299500180] |In 1843 the 1st Grenadiers took part in the ⌊>Scinde War>⌋, seeing action at ⌊>Hyderabad>⌋ in March -- the war would see ⌊>Scinde>⌋ annexed and absorbed into British-controlled ⌊>India>⌋.
[1000299500190] |The Regiment saw further service in the ⌊>First Sikh War>⌋ after ⌊>Sikh>⌋ forces invaded Indian territory.
[1000299500200] |It was involved in a number of engagements in the conflict, including the last battle of the war at ⌊>Sobraon>⌋ in February 1846.
[1000299500210] |The battle saw the Sikh forces resoundingly defeated.

[1000299500220] |The ⌊>Second Afghan War>⌋ began in 1878 and the regiment were employed in the vicinity of the ⌊>Bolan Pass>⌋ in ⌊>1879>⌋, until finally moving up to ⌊>Kandahar>⌋ in March 1880.
[1000299500230] |Commanded by Lieutenant-Colonel ⌊>Anderson>⌋, they were part of a British-Indian column intended to assist an Afghan Army in quelling a revolt led by ⌊>Ayub Khan>⌋, the ruler of ⌊>Herat>⌋, who sought to depose the newley-appointed British-backed Amir of Afghanistan, ⌊>Abdur Rahman Khan>⌋.
[1000299500240] |The Regiment took part in the ⌊>Battle of Maiwand>⌋ on ⌊>27 July>⌋ ⌊>1880>⌋.
[1000299500250] |At the battle the British-Indian column, which was composed of just under 2,600 troops and led by Brigadier ⌊>Burrows>⌋, fought an Afghan force of about 25,000.

[1000299500260] |The British began the battle with an artillery barrage that the Afghans responded to via their own artillery at about 11:20am; the Grenadiers were on the left flank of the British-Indian force and were in an exposed position that saw them take the brunt of the Afghan barrage, sustaining significant casualties.
[1000299500270] |Shortly after noon, the Afghan infantry began the attack and the Grenadiers were heavily involved in the attempts to repulse the constant attacks, inflicting heavy casualties on the Afghans.
[1000299500280] |At about 1:00pm the ⌊/Grenadiers/⌋ confronted a large group of Afghans and at about 2:30pm. two companies of ⌊>Jacob's Rifles>⌋, who had been positioned to the left of the Grenadiers, were attacked; they eventually wavered in the face of such an ovewhelming force, straight into the ranks of the Grenadiers.
[1000299500290] |The battery of the ⌊>Royal Horse Artillery>⌋ subsequently withdrew and the Grenadiers, as-well as the rest of the Indian forces, fled towards the ⌊>66th Foot>⌋, the sole British infantry regiment present.
[1000299500300] |The column's cavalry attempted to restore some stability to the situation but to no avail.
[1000299500310] |Parts of the Grenadiers and Jacob's Rifles withdrew to ⌊>Mahmudabad>⌋ while the 66th Foot and the rest of the Grenadiers withdrew towards ⌊>Khig>⌋; there, the 66th made a gallant ⌊>last stand>⌋ in a garden, fighting to the last man.

[1000299500320] |The battle had been a devastating defeat for the British-Indian forces: over 1,100 casualties had been sustained, but they had inflicted over 7,000 casualties upon the Afghan forces.
[1000299500330] |The Grenadiers commanding officer (CO) was severely wounded during the battle and his life was saved by ⌊>Risaldar>⌋ Dhonkhul Singh of the ⌊>3rd Bombay Light Cavalry>⌋.
[1000299500340] |The British-Indian survivors eventually made it back to British-held Kandahar.
[1000299500350] |The city was soon besieged by Afghan rebels until a relief force, led by Major-General ⌊>Roberts>⌋, arrived from the capital city, ⌊>Kabul>⌋, on ⌊>31 August>⌋.

[1000299500360] |In 1885 the Regiment took part in the ⌊>Third Burmese War>⌋ -- the last war between the British and ⌊>Burma>⌋.
[1000299500370] |The war saw Upper Burma annexed and the end of Burmese independence.
[1000299500380] |The Regiment gained its last ⌊>Theatre Honour>⌋ of the 19th Century for its involvement in the war, "Burma 1885-87".

[1000299500390] |In 1901 the Regiment deployed to the British territory of ⌊>Aden>⌋ (now part of the ⌊>Yemen>⌋), also having its name changed to the ⌊∗1st Grenadier Bombay Infantry∗⌋.
[1000299500400] |In 1903 the Regiment was renumbered to become the ⌊∗101st Grenadiers∗⌋.
[1000299500410] |Elements of the Regiment saw service during operations in 1902-05 to quell an uprising by ⌊>Dervishes>⌋, led by ⌊>Mohammad bin Abdullah Hassan>⌋ (known to the British as the 'Mad Mullah').
[1000299500420] |During operations in Somliland, Captain ⌊>George Murray Rolland>⌋ won the ⌊>Victoria Cross>⌋ (VC) for his actions at ⌊>Daratoleh>⌋ on ⌊>22 April>⌋ ⌊>1903>⌋.
[1000299500430] |The operations against the 'Mad Mullah' did not conclude until 1905 with the signing of a peace agreement -- the Mullah gained some territory in ⌊>Italian Somaliland>⌋.
[1000299500440] |The Mullah reneged on this agreement when he resumed hostilities against the British in 1907, and would continue to do so until 1920.

[1000299500450] |⌊=First World War¦2=⌋
[1000299500460] |The ⌊>First World War>⌋ began in August 1914, a war that pitted the British Empire, ⌊>France>⌋ and their Allies against ⌊>Germany>⌋ and its allies.
[1000299500470] |During the conflict, the Regiment saw service in ⌊>Africa>⌋ and the ⌊>Middle East>⌋.
[1000299500480] |The 101st raised a 2nd Battalion in 1917 which saw service in ⌊>Egypt>⌋; it was disbanded in 1921.

[1000299500490] |The Regiment took part in operations in ⌊>German East Africa>⌋ from the beginning of the campaign there in November 1914.
[1000299500500] |There, the British encountered a formidable opponent in the form of ⌊>Paul Erich von Lettow-Vorbeck>⌋.
[1000299500510] |The 101st took part in the initial landings and the ⌊>Battle of Tanga>⌋, a German victory, that saw the British and Indian forces, including the 101st, sustain significant casualties that compelled them to retreat back to their ships.
[1000299500520] |In January 1915, a company of the 101st took part in the ⌊>Battle of Jassin>⌋ that saw both sides sustain heavy casualties which compelled von Lettow-Vorbeck to avoid pitched battles with the British forces.
[1000299500530] |Due to this defeat, the British garrison in ⌊>Jassin>⌋ surrendered, after no relief force had arrived, with nearly 300 British and Indians troops taken ⌊>prisoner>⌋, including the company of the 101st, but were subsequently released on ⌊>parole>⌋ with the pledge that they would have no further participation in the war.

[1000299500540] |One company of the Regiment acted with the ⌊>5th Light Infantry>⌋ in another attempt to capture ⌊>Tanga>⌋ in July 1916.
[1000299500550] |The port -- which had, for the most part, been abandoned -- was, indeed, successfully captured.
[1000299500560] |Some of von Lettow-Vorbeck's forces had remained to snipe at the Indian forces; these ⌊>snipers>⌋ proved to be quite a deadly nuisance that required intense patrolling to remove the threat.
[1000299500570] |For the ⌊/Regiment's/⌋ involvement in the campaign it was awarded the Theatre Honour "East Africa 1914-16".

[1000299500580] |The 101st later saw service in the Middle East in the ⌊>Palestine theatre>⌋ -- this theatre was the second largest, in terms of troop numbers, after the ⌊>Western Front>⌋.
[1000299500590] |Their opposition was the ⌊>Ottoman Empire>⌋ that controlled ⌊>Palestine>⌋, and was an ally of Germany.
[1000299500600] |The Regiment took part in the attempts to capture the important port of ⌊>Gaza>⌋ and by the end of December 1917 the Allies were in control of much of Palestine, including the symbolic capture of ⌊>Jerusalem>⌋.
[1000299500610] |In July 1918 the ⌊/Regiment/⌋ took part in the Ghurabeh raid that saw intense fighting and over 100 Ottomans taken prisoner.
[1000299500620] |The Regiment later took part in the ⌊>Megiddo Offensive>⌋ -- the WWI equivalent of the German ⌊>Blitzkrieg>⌋ during ⌊>World War II>⌋ -- and took part in the attempts to capture ⌊>Nablus>⌋.
[1000299500630] |The Ottomans signed an ⌊>Armistice>⌋ with the Allies on ⌊>30 October>⌋.
[1000299500640] |The First World War finally ended on ⌊>11 November>⌋ ⌊>1918>⌋ with the signing of the Armistice between the Allies and Germany.

[1000299500650] |⌊=Post-War¦2=⌋
[1000299500660] |The Regiment would have no respite in the aftermath of WWI -- they deployed to ⌊>British Somaliland>⌋ to take took part in operations against the 'Mad Mullah' once more.
[1000299500670] |The campaign was known as the Combined Forces Operation as the ⌊>Royal Navy>⌋ (RN) and ⌊>Royal Air Force>⌋ (RAF) also contributed forces; the RN provided five warships, including the carrier ⌊>HMS ⌊/Ark Royal/⌋>⌋, while the RAF provided a flight of ⌊>DH9>⌋ bombers.
[1000299500680] |The campaign succeeded in defeating the 'Mad Mullah' - who had fought the British in Somaliland since 1900 - and forcing him and his followers to flee to ⌊>Abyssinia>⌋ (now ⌊>Ethiopia>⌋), where he died the following year.

[1000299500690] |In consequence of the Indian Army reforms of 1922, the Regiment amalgamated with 5 other regiments to form 5 battalions of the ⌊>4th Bombay Grenadiers>⌋; the 101st Grenadiers became the 1st Battalion of the new regiment.
[1000299500700] |The battalion had the distinction of being allowed to have its own ⌊>cap badge>⌋.
[1000299500710] |After Indian became independent from the ⌊>British Empire>⌋, the 4th Grenadiers were allocated to the ⌊>Indian Army>⌋, becoming simply The Grenadiers.
[1000299500720] |The Battalion that was once the 101st was transferred to the ⌊>Brigade of the Guards>⌋ in 1952, becoming its 2nd Battalion (2 Guards).
