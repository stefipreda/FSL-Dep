[1000312100040] |The division fought on the ⌊>Eastern Front>⌋, spending much of its existence as part of ⌊>Ninth Army>⌋ assigned to ⌊>Army Group Centre>⌋.
[1000312100050] |In 1943 it was involved in ⌊>Operation Citadel>⌋ and its aftermath, losing much of its strength in a series of fierce defensive battles around ⌊>Orel>⌋; by October it was listed as assigned to ⌊>Second Army>⌋ and reduced to ⌊/⌊>Kampfgruppe>⌋/⌋ level.

[1000312300050] |Base downsizing through the ⌊>BRAC>⌋ process removed the wing's ⌊>F-15C Eagle>⌋s in 2005, leaving the 102nd with an intelligence gathering mission that will be fully active starting in 2010.
[1000312300060] |It is one of three ⌊>Air National Guard>⌋ wings that works with the ⌊>Air Force Intelligence, Surveillance and Reconnaissance Agency>⌋.

[1000312300070] |⌊=History¦2=⌋
[1000312300080] |⌊=Origins¦3=⌋
[1000312300090] |After ⌊>World War I>⌋ ended, there was a general interest in organizing aviation assets for the National Guard system.
[1000312300100] |At the time, in the US force structure aircraft were organized into infantry units in a fashion similar to other weapons, like artillery.
[1000312300110] |Guard units without their own aircraft units would need units from other forces to be sent to operate with them, a situation no-one thought was promising.
[1000312300120] |The War Department agreed that the Guard should organize aviation squadrons as an organic part of the 18 infantry divisions assigned to the National Guard.

[1000312300130] |In Massachusetts, the Archie Club, composed of former Army Air Service pilots, lobbied for the formation of an air unit for the ⌊>Massachusetts National Guard>⌋.
[1000312300140] |The state had been allotted the entire 26th Guard Division.
[1000312300150] |On June 27, 1921, the Adjutant General of Massachusetts authorized the organization of the 101st Observation Squadron, and within weeks 15 veteran World War I pilots were commissioned and assigned to the 101st under the command of Capt. James K. Knowles.
[1000312300160] |The 101st built its own air base on land-filled tidal flats at Jeffries Point, East Boston.

[1000312300170] |The 101 flew its ⌊>Curtiss JN-4>⌋ "Jenny" aircraft throughout New England at air shows, county fairs and other events.
[1000312300180] |In addition, the 101st attended two-week summer camps that simulated forward deployments.
[1000312300190] |Pilots flew their ⌊>Curtiss O-11>⌋s to temporary fields on Cape Cod while ground crews followed in trucks.
[1000312300200] |One of these fields became ⌊>Cape Cod Airport>⌋.
[1000312300210] |In 1933 Jeffery Field was rebuilt with new hangers and administrative buildings, and renamed ⌊>Logan Airport>⌋ in honor of Major General Edward L. Logan, who commanded the 26th Division from 1923 to 1928.

[1000312300220] |The 101st was ordered into state service in 1936 and 1938 during a devastating flood and hurricane to fly observation missions and to drop food and equipment to stranded fishermen and the residents of ⌊>Isle au Haut>⌋, ⌊>Maine>⌋ The 101st helped gained fame when it played a big part in the ⌊>U.S. Army Air Service>⌋'s flight around the world.
[1000312300230] |It then cared for the ⌊>Spirit of St. Louis>⌋ when ⌊>Charles Lindbergh>⌋ visited the state.

[1000312300240] |⌊=World War II¦4=⌋
[1000312300250] |In 1940, the 101st was separated from the ⌊>26th Infantry Division>⌋ and in November was ordered into active Federal service for intensive training.
[1000312300260] |Initially the 101st’s 25 officers and 133 enlisted men remained at home station until ⌊>July 31>⌋ ⌊>1941>⌋ when it was then moved from Logan to ⌊>Otis Field>⌋ at ⌊>Camp Edwards>⌋.
[1000312300270] |Otis Field was named in after 1st Lt Frank J. Otis, Jr., MD, a 101st flight surgeon who was killed in a flight accident in 1938.
[1000312300280] |The 101st participated in the North Carolina maneuvers in the fall of 1941 and returned to Otis on ⌊>December 6>⌋ ⌊>1941>⌋.

[1000312300290] |With the outbreak of World War II, the 101st was assigned to fly ⌊>anti-submarine>⌋ patrols off the coast of ⌊>New England>⌋ until ⌊>September 10>⌋ ⌊>1942>⌋.
[1000312300300] |By then many of its original members has been reassigned during the expansion of the ⌊>Army Air Forces>⌋.
[1000312300310] |During the next two years, the 101st was transferred to several bases and on May 20, 1944 had its mission changed when it was re designated as the 39th Photo Reconnaissance Squadron.
[1000312300320] |It was then placed under the command of the ⌊>Ninth Air Force>⌋ and deployed to the European Theater in December, 1944 with 45 officers and 297 enlisted men.
[1000312300330] |The 39th flew both P-38s and P-51s during operational missions from January, 1945 to the end of the war in May.
[1000312300340] |The 39th returned to the states in August, 1945 and was re designated as the 101st Fighter Squadron in May 1946, and then inactivated two month later.

[1000312300350] |Veterans of the 101st and ⌊>Army Air Force>⌋ reorganized the 101st at Logan Airport on July 29, 1946.
[1000312300360] |The squadron was equipped with the ⌊>P-47 Thunderbolt>⌋ and was federally recognized on October 15, 1946.

[1000312300370] |⌊=Cold War¦3=⌋
[1000312300380] |In the post-war era the National Guard Bureau began a major expansion of the Air units.
[1000312300390] |Massachusetts was alloted the 67th Fighter Wing, which consisted of the 101st, the 131st Fighter Squadrons, the 202nd Air Service Group, 601st Signal Construction Company, 101st Communications Squadron, 101st Air Control Squadron, 151st Air Control and Warning Group, 567th Air Force Band, 101st Weather Flight and the 1801st Aviation Engineer Company.

[1000312300400] |With the formation of the ⌊>US Air Force>⌋ the Guard units suffered from neglect.
[1000312300410] |In the midst of the switch to jet fighters, the Guard units were left with their handed-down and generally overused WWII propeller aircraft, and had little money for training.
[1000312300420] |As the Cold War intensified, the Air Forced looked to the Guard to fill US-based interception missions and started overhauling their organization.
[1000312300430] |On 1 Nov. 1950 the 67th Fighter Wing was inactivated and replaced by the 102nd Fighter Wing, including just the 101st and 131st along with their associated support units, and assigned to ⌊>Air Defense Command>⌋.
[1000312300440] |The squadrons were issued F-84Bs, but these aircraft were recalled and replaced by F-51s which were flown until 1954 when the F-94 replaced the Twin Mustangs.
[1000312300450] |In 1952 the 253d Combat Communications Group was activated and added to the 102nd.

[1000312300460] |From 1956 to 1976, the 102d was headed by ⌊>Brigadier General Charles W. Sweeney>⌋, who piloted the ⌊>B-29 Superfortress>⌋, which dropped the ⌊>Fat Man>⌋ atomic bomb on ⌊>Nagasaki, Japan>⌋ in 1945.

[1000312300470] |⌊=Berlin Crisis¦4=⌋
[1000312300480] |During the summer of 1961, as the ⌊>Berlin Crisis>⌋ unfolded, several USAF reserve units were notified on ⌊>August 16>⌋ of their pending recall to active duty.
[1000312300490] |On October 1st, the ⌊>Massachusetts Air National Guard>⌋'s 102nd Tactical Fighter Wing and its three squadrons, the ⌊>101st Tactical Fighter Squadron>⌋, the ⌊>131st Tactical Fighter Squadron>⌋, and the ⌊>138th Tactical Fighter Squadron>⌋ went on active duty at ⌊>Otis Air Force Base>⌋.

[1000312300500] |Between the 28th and 30th of October, the 102nd TFW departed ⌊>Logan International Airport>⌋ to ⌊>Phalsbourg>⌋, France.
[1000312300510] |The wing deployed 82 ⌊>F-86H Sabre>⌋s.
[1000312300520] |The 101st's planes were marked with green stripes on their vertical stabilizers, the 131st with red stripes, and the 138th with yellow stripes.
[1000312300530] |In addition two ⌊>C-47 Skytrain>⌋s and six ⌊>T-33 Shooting Star>⌋ aircraft were assigned to the wing for support and training purposes.
[1000312300540] |The 102d's primary mission at the time was to provide close air support to ⌊>NATO>⌋ ground forces and air interdiction.
[1000312300550] |Starting on ⌊>December 5>⌋, the 102nd began deploying to ⌊>Wheelus Air Base>⌋, ⌊>Libya>⌋ for gunnery training.

[1000312300560] |During its time in Europe, the 102nd participated in several ⌊>USAF>⌋ and ⌊>NATO>⌋ exercises, including a deployment to ⌊>Leck Air Base>⌋, ⌊>West Germany>⌋ near the Danish border.
[1000312300570] |At Leck, ground and support crews from both countries exchanged duties, learning how to perform aircraft maintenance and operational support tasks.

[1000312300580] |On ⌊>May 7>⌋ ⌊>1962>⌋, the Seventeenth Air Force stated that the 102nd would deploy back to the United States during the summer, returning in July 1962.
[1000312300590] |Regular USAF personnel, along with a group of ANG personnel who volunteered to remain on active duty formed the 480th Tactical Fighter Squadron of the newly activated ⌊>366th Tactical Fighter Wing>⌋.

[1000312300600] |⌊=Relocation to Otis¦4=⌋
[1000312300610] |In 1968, the 102nd Tactical Fighter Wing moved to ⌊>Otis Air Force Base>⌋.
[1000312300620] |The wing flew the ⌊>F-84F Thunderstreak>⌋ until June 1971, when a squadron of ⌊>F-100D Super Sabres>⌋ was transferred directly from units fighting the ⌊>Vietnam War>⌋.
[1000312300630] |After making the transition to the "Hun," the Mach 2 ⌊>F-106 Delta Darts>⌋ soon arrived to replace them.
[1000312300640] |On ⌊>June 10>⌋ ⌊>1972>⌋, after completing the move to the F-106, the unit officially became the 102nd Air Defense Wing.
[1000312300650] |On December 30, 1973, Otis AFB was inactivated and transferred to the Massachusetts ANG as Otis Air National Guard Base.

[1000312300660] |The wing participated in the interception of Soviet ⌊>TU-95 Bear>⌋ bombers on many occasions, the first of which occurred off ⌊>Long Island>⌋ in 1975.
[1000312300670] |Many of these occasions included escorting the aircraft to ⌊>Cuba>⌋.
[1000312300680] |Other escort missions involved the escorting of drug smuggling planes and the identifying of one mysterious ghost plane, which turned out later to be a weather balloon.

[1000312300690] |In 1976, the 102nd Fighter Interceptor Group was deactivated and re-formed as the 102nd Fighter Interceptor Wing, assuming authority for the 177th and 125th Fighter Interceptor Groups in ⌊>Atlantic City, NJ>⌋, and ⌊>Jacksonville, FL>⌋, and for the 107th and 147th Fighter Interceptor Groups, flying F-4C at ⌊>Niagara Falls, NY>⌋, and ⌊>Ellington Field>⌋, TX.

[1000312300700] |The 102nd FIW deactivated its F-106 on January 5, 1988.
[1000312300710] |Between January and April 1988, the wing converted to the F-15A Eagle and resumed its alert commitment at Otis, and also provided an alert detachment at ⌊>Loring AFB>⌋.
[1000312300720] |The 102nd was the first ANG unit to be equipped with the F-15.

[1000312300730] |⌊=Post-Cold War¦3=⌋
[1000312300740] |The wing continued air defense mission after the fall of the ⌊>Soviet Union>⌋.
[1000312300750] |Examples of this include a 1992 deployment of eight pilots, five F-15 Eagles, and 48 maintenance and security personnel, for five days to ⌊>Canadian Forces Base Goose Bay>⌋, ⌊>Labrador, Canada>⌋.
[1000312300760] |Another is the humanitarian deployment of 50 personnel from the 102nd Civil Engineering Squadron under field conditions, to the island of ⌊>Eleuthera>⌋ in the ⌊>Bahamas>⌋ in July 1993.
[1000312300770] |They helped to rebuild school buildings and municipal facilities that were damaged by ⌊>Hurricane Andrew>⌋.

[1000312300780] |Between 1991 and 1995 the wing deployed to ⌊>Panama>⌋ as part of ⌊>Operation Coronet Nighthawk>⌋, a drug interdiction operation.
[1000312300790] |From 1995 to 1998 the wing deployed to ⌊>Iceland>⌋ for 45 days of air defense duty.
[1000312300800] |During 1998 members both trained for and performed in real-world contingency assignments in ⌊>Iceland>⌋, ⌊>Canada>⌋, ⌊>Korea>⌋, and ⌊>Europe>⌋.
[1000312300810] |In 1999 the wing participated in ⌊>Operation Northern Watch>⌋ when it deployed with its F-15 Eagle aircraft to ⌊>Turkey>⌋ to patrol and enforce the no-fly zone north of the 36th Parallel in northern ⌊>Iraq>⌋.
[1000312300820] |The wing again deployed more than 350 personnel to the ⌊>Middle East>⌋ and ⌊>Europe>⌋ in 2000 to participate in ⌊>Operation Southern Watch>⌋.

[1000312300860] |On ⌊>September 11, 2001>⌋, two planes were hijacked and flown towards New York City.
[1000312300870] |Then ⌊>Federal Aviation Administration>⌋ contacted the ⌊>North American Aerospace Defense Command>⌋'s ⌊>Northeast Air Defense Sector>⌋ at ⌊>Rome, New York>⌋, bypassing standard procedures.
[1000312300880] |NORAD ordered the 102nd Fighter Wing to scramble its jets.
[1000312300890] |Two F-15s piloted by Lieutenant Colonel Timothy Duffy and Major Daniel Nash were scrambled and took off to fly to New York.
[1000312300900] |Difficulties in pinpointing the exact location of Flight 11 led to a delay of five minutes before the scramble order was given at 8:43.
[1000312300910] |When Flight 11 hit the North Tower at 8:46, the two ⌊>F-15 Eagles>⌋ that had been ordered to scramble were still on the runway at Otis; they did not take to the air until 8:52.
[1000312300920] |Lacking a target, the F-15s were directed toward military-controlled airspace off the Long Island coast to avoid New York area air traffic.
[1000312300930] |Uncertain about what to do, the planes were ordered to 'hold as needed' there.
[1000312300940] |At 9:02, Flight 175 hit the South Tower while the fighters flew to their holding position.
[1000312300950] |The Northeast Air Defense Sector was not contacted about this hijacked plane until 9:03.
[1000312300960] |From 9:09 to 9:13 the F-15s stayed in the holding pattern.
[1000312300970] |At 9:13, the pilots of the F-15s told FAA Boston Center that they were heading for Manhattan to establish a Combat Air Patrol (CAP) over the area.
[1000312300980] |The F-15s arrived over Manhattan at 9:25.
[1000312300990] |Duffy later commented, "As we're climbing out, we go supersonic on the way, which is kind of nonstandard for us.
[1000312301000] |And, and Nasty even called me on the, radio and said, Duff, you're super.
[1000312301010] |I said yeah, I know.
[1000312301020] |You know, don't worry about it. ...
[1000312301030] |I just wanted to get there".

[1000312301040] |⌊=Operations Enduring and Iraqi Freedom¦4=⌋
[1000312301050] |More than 600 wing members were mobilized for ⌊>Operation Noble Eagle>⌋.
[1000312301060] |The wing began flying around-the-clock ⌊>combat air patrols>⌋ missions immediately thereafter, and continued doing so until February 2002.
[1000312301070] |The wing never deployed overseas to support the wars in Afghanistan and Iraq but it did continue to patrol the Northeastern United States skies.

[1000312301080] |⌊=BRAC 2005¦4=⌋
[1000312301090] |The BRAC 2005 commission originally planned to close ⌊>Otis Air National Guard Base>⌋ and dissolve the 102nd Locals argued that this would leave a huge gap in the national air defenses.
[1000312301100] |BRAC officials, after visiting the base, decided to keep it open, but the 102nd would still lose its planes, only this time they were only going to the ⌊>104th Fighter Wing>⌋, based at ⌊>Barnes Municipal Airport>⌋.

[1000312301110] |The wing hosted its last airshow with the ⌊>F-15C Eagle>⌋ at the end of Air Force Week in August, 2007.
[1000312301120] |The wing shared the last months with the F-15 with the ⌊>101st Air Refueling Wing>⌋, the ⌊>103d Fighter Wing>⌋, and the ⌊>104th Fighter Wing>⌋.
[1000312301130] |Beginning in 2007, their planes began moving to ⌊>Barnes Municipal Airport>⌋.
[1000312301140] |With the grounding of the ⌊>F-15 Eagles>⌋, the ⌊>158th Fighter Wing>⌋, which is based in ⌊>Vermont>⌋ temporarily took over the role of patrolling the Northeast's skies.
[1000312301150] |This interruption of the F-15's flight, coinciding with the transitioning of the fighter jets to the ⌊>104th Fighter Wing>⌋, created some issues.
[1000312301160] |The move was originally scheduled to be completed at the end of January, but the grounding of the F-15's in late 2007 and early 2008 delayed this move to the end of February.

[1000312301170] |On ⌊>January 24>⌋ ⌊>2008>⌋, the 102nd Fighter Wing officially flew its last patrol mission.
[1000312301180] |The unit's wing commander, Colonel Anthony Schiavi, led the flight, accompanied by Major Daniel Nash, who was one of the first responders for 9/11.
[1000312301190] |Fire trucks were on hand when the team landed a half-hour later, giving the planes and the pilots the customary ceremonial hose-down for the last time.

[1000312301200] |⌊=New Mission¦4=⌋
[1000312301210] |As soon as it was announced that the wing would be kept alive and ⌊>Otis Air National Guard Base>⌋ would remain open, people began thinking of the future for the 102nd.
[1000312301220] |There was talk that the wing could transition to an intelligence mission so that it could help support the growing ⌊>War On Terror>⌋.
[1000312301230] |The plans hit a roadblock when it was announced that there were few funds left with which the wing could use to transition into its new mission.

[1000312301240] |The new mission was finally confirmed when Governor ⌊>Deval Patrick>⌋ announced that the wing would transition to an intelligence mission as soon as the planes left.
[1000312301250] |Original BRAC plans only said that a ⌊>Distributed Common Ground Station>⌋ would be created at Otis.
[1000312301260] |This didn't include the air guardsmen affected by the loss of their jobs.
[1000312301270] |The issue was finally resolved when the Air Force announced its plans, right before the F-15's started to leave for Barnes.
[1000312301280] |On ⌊>April 1>⌋ ⌊>2008>⌋, the 102nd Fighter Wing was re designated as the 102nd Intelligence Wing, with a formal ceremony on ⌊>April 6>⌋.

[1000312500050] |The 261st Rifle Division was originally formed in 1941.
[1000312500060] |It was probably activated in the ⌊>Odessa Military District>⌋ in July-August 1941.
[1000312500070] |It was assigned to the ⌊>12th Army>⌋ of the North Caucasus Front later in 1941 and remained with that Army up to at least August 1942 but then was assigned to the ⌊>Transcaucasian Front>⌋'s Black Sea Group of Forces.
[1000312500080] |It then spent much of the later part of World War II, from January 1, 1943, onwards with the small ⌊>45th Army>⌋ of the ⌊>Transcaucasian Front>⌋ which was guarding the USSR's borders with ⌊>Turkey>⌋.
[1000312500090] |After the war ended, the 261st Rifle Division was briefly designated the 37th Rifle Division but then became the 127th Motor Rifle Division in 1965.

[1000312500410] |Furthermore, the ⌊>Armenian Air Force>⌋ relies partially upon the Russian ⌊>MiG-29>⌋s located at the military base, for the defense of Armenia's airspace.

[1000312500420] |The Russian military base was deployed on the territory of Armenia as early as 1996 (before that, the installation was still known as the 127th MRD of the ⌊>Soviet Ground Forces>⌋).

[1000312600050] |The regiment was organized at Camp Ward, located on a farm.
[1000312600060] |Eight-hundred and forty-five men from ⌊>Detroit>⌋, southern ⌊>Michigan>⌋, and ⌊>Ontario>⌋, ⌊>Canada>⌋, volunteered for the regiment.
[1000312600070] |Some of these volunteers were escaped slaves from the ⌊>Underground Railroad>⌋, and some were fighting to free their family members who may have still been in slavery.
[1000312600080] |During training, a regimental band was formed which toured to recruit more volunteers.

[1000313700020] |It is now owned by the developer British Land who intend to demolish and replace the tower with a 163 metre office skyscraper.

[1000313700030] |⌊=Current building¦2=⌋
[1000313700040] |The building was designed by ⌊>John Madin>⌋ and is of ⌊>Brutalist architecture>⌋.
[1000313700050] |The colour scheme is very similar to that of ⌊>The McLaren Building>⌋ also in Birmingham.
[1000313700060] |It is brown and dark green and forms a prominent part of the Birmingham skyline.
[1000313700070] |It is also one of the newest and tallest buildings in the Colmore Conservation Area, and is a frequent perching point for the city centre's ⌊>Peregrine Falcon>⌋s.

[1000313700080] |Designs for the building were first aired to the public in ⌊>1964>⌋ and it was remarked that it had drawn inspiration from the ⌊>University of Pittsburgh>⌋ by ⌊>Louis Kahn>⌋.
[1000313700090] |Construction began in ⌊>1973>⌋ and was completed three years later.
[1000313700100] |The original metal doors remain with the abstract triangle design, based on the NatWest logo, intact.
[1000313700110] |The exterior is covered in abstract plaster murals and bronze matt ceramic tiles.
[1000313700120] |The concrete coffered ceiling is covered in gold leaf.
[1000313700130] |The lift shaft and two ventilation towers are constructed using brick.
[1000313700140] |There are four plant floors at the top of the tower and 100 car park spaces in a basement car park that has been left disused upon the discovery of asbestos.

[1000313700150] |A planning application was submitted to Birmingham City Council in late-⌊>2005>⌋ for the redevelopment of the tower.
[1000313700160] |However, this is only a fraction of the entire area scheduled for redevelopment.

[1000313700170] |⌊=Proposed replacement¦2=⌋
[1000313700180] |The tower was bought by ⌊>British Land>⌋ in ⌊>January 2007>⌋.
[1000313700190] |They announced their intentions to demolish the tower and replace it with another.
[1000313700200] |Between ⌊>October 9>⌋ and ⌊>October 11>⌋ ⌊>2007>⌋, British Land and ⌊>Hamilton Architects>⌋ hosted a public consultation in the banking hall to 103 Colmore Row to showcase the designs for the tower they want to construct on the site.
[1000313700210] |The proposed office tower will be ⌊λ163 metres (534.8 ft)¦163¦m¦ft¦1¦Convertλ⌋ tall to the top of a light mast and consist of 28 occupiable office floors and three plant levels.
[1000313700220] |The tower would be the tallest building in the city, only surpassed by the proposed ⌊>VTP200>⌋.
[1000313700230] |It will have a roof height of 137 metres.
[1000313700240] |GVA Grimley have been hired as planning consultants and the project will cost £160 million.

[1000313700250] |A planning application was submitted to ⌊>Birmingham City Council>⌋ on ⌊>April 29>⌋ ⌊>2008>⌋.
[1000313700260] |The proposed tower was very similar to the design exhibited in October 2007, although the new design had a further four floors of reception and retail space with the Colmore Row elevation consisting of a four storey ⌊>colonnade>⌋.
[1000313700270] |The light mast will extend from ground level to ⌊λ25 metres (82 ft)¦25¦m¦ft¦0¦Convertλ⌋ above the roof level, giving the building a total height of 160 metres.
[1000313700280] |As it is proposed to be constructed on the highest ground in the city centre, it will be one of the most prominent buildings on the skyline.
[1000313700290] |The tower will also have a green roof to act as a natural habitat for protected bird species and will also provide a 30% reduction in energy use.

[1000313700300] |The building received the backing of the ⌊>Birmingham Civic Society>⌋, however the Victorian Society commented that they were "extremely disappointed" with the proposal.

[1000313900020] |⌊=History¦2=⌋
[1000313900030] |103 Search and Rescue Flight was formed at ⌊>RCAF Station Shearwater>⌋ on ⌊>April 1>⌋, ⌊>1947>⌋.
[1000313900040] |It moved to ⌊>RCAF Station Greenwood>⌋ that same year where it remained until three years later when it was renamed 103 Rescue Unit (RU).
[1000313900050] |While at Greenwood, 103 RU adopted an image of "Albert" (a ⌊>Saint Bernard>⌋ rescue dog) for its crest.
[1000313900060] |103 RU also took on the motto ⌊/Seek and Save/⌋ to symbolize its search and rescue role.

[1000313900070] |103 RU moved to ⌊>RCAF Station Summerside>⌋ where it remained until unification of the ⌊>Canadian Forces>⌋ in ⌊>1968>⌋ when it was disbanded.
[1000313900080] |The remnants of 103 RU formed the new ⌊>413 Transport and Rescue Squadron>⌋ at ⌊>CFB Summerside>⌋.

[1000313900090] |Canada ratified ⌊>UNCLOS III>⌋ (1973-1982) during the mid-1970s and declared a 200 nautical mile ⌊>Exclusive Economic Zone>⌋ off its shores in 1977, creating an enormous new area of ocean responsibility for search and rescue.
[1000313900100] |That year saw the 103 RU reactivated at the strategically situated ⌊>Gander International Airport>⌋ to meet the unique search and rescue demands of the western North Atlantic.
[1000313900110] |Canada has been given responsibility for air/marine SAR operations west of 30ºW and north of 40ºN off the coast of ⌊>Newfoundland>⌋.

[1000313900120] |At the time of its reactivation, 103 RU was equipped with the ⌊>CH-113 Labrador>⌋ twin-rotor helicopter and was stationed in a permanent hangar constructed on the grounds of the airport in 1977 at a ⌊>Canadian Forces Station>⌋ named ⌊>CFS Gander>⌋.

[1000313900130] |During the 1980s, CFS Gander was redesignated a ⌊>Canadian Forces Base>⌋ and renamed CFB Gander.
[1000313900140] |During the 1990s, the primary lodger unit at the base became 9 Wing, with its sole sub-unit being 103 RU.

[1000313900150] |In March 1997 the 103 RU was granted squadron status and renamed ⌊∗103 Search and Rescue Squadron∗⌋.
[1000313900160] |In June 1997, ⌊>His Royal Highness>⌋, ⌊>Prince Philip>⌋ presented the 103 Search and Rescue Squadron with its Standard.

[1000313900170] |⌊=Current role¦2=⌋
[1000313900180] |Today, 103 Search and Rescue (SAR) Squadron is charged with providing a 24 hour a day, 365 days a year ⌊>search and rescue>⌋ capability to the Halifax Rescue Coordination Centre (RCC).
[1000313900190] |The Squadron is responsible for a massive area, covering the lower ⌊>Arctic>⌋, the ⌊>Maritimes>⌋, ⌊>Newfoundland and Labrador>⌋ and all offshore waters in the region.

[1000313900200] |Considering that the number of SAR cases in the Newfoundland Region, which are actual distress cases, is twice the national average, 103 Squadron is kept very busy.

[1000313900210] |Given 103's proximity to major ⌊>fishing>⌋ grounds and shipping routes, it isn't surprising that the majority of its missions are marine-based.
[1000313900220] |SAR crews routinely find vessels in distress, overdue boats and sick or injured seamen.
[1000313900230] |Crews can easily find themselves nearly 200 miles offshore and with the introduction of ⌊>Hibernia>⌋, a refuelling site at an oil production platform, the potential to go even further out to sea has proven very much a reality.

[1000313900240] |⌊/Outcasts,/⌋ the name affectionately given to the personnel of 103 Squadron, perform a variety of tasks to keep the Squadron up and running, including flying the helicopters, maintaining and servicing the Aircraft as well as administering and supporting the Squadron.

[1000313900250] |Its approximately fifty military personnel and twenty-six civilian employees operate three ⌊>CH-149 Cormorant>⌋ helicopters.

[1000313900260] |The CH-149 Cormorant can carry 12 stretchers or a load of 5,000 kg.
[1000313900270] |Its ice protection system allows it to operate in continuous icing conditions.
[1000313900280] |The Cormorant routinely conducts rescues that would have been impossible for its predecessor, the ⌊>CH-113 Labrador>⌋.
