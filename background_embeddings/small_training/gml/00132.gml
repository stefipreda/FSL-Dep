[1000324000050] |In Manchester some elements had existed as early as 1804 when the Duke of Gloucester inspected the Heaton Artillery Volunteers.
[1000324000060] |Later on some battalions of the Kings Regiment and the Prince of Wales Volunteers rebadged as Lancashire Gunners.
[1000324000070] |During the Great War they formed 25 Artillery Brigades or Infantry Battalions and during the Second World War 17 Gunner Regiments.
[1000324000080] |These Regiments had a particularly distinguished record, winning two Victoria Crosses.
[1000324000090] |The Bolton Artillery at Serapeum in February 1915, were the first field artillery volunteers in the Great War to fire a shell in anger.
[1000324000100] |In both World Wars the Regiments served and fought in all theatres.

[1000324000110] |In 1955 there were 33 Territorial Gunner Regiments in the North West of England.
[1000324000120] |In 1967 seven Regiments remained and were amalgamated to form 103rd (Lancashire Artillery Volunteers) Light Air Defence Regiment Royal Artillery (Volunteers), The West Lancashire Regiment (T) RA and The South Lancashire Territorials (Prince of Wales Volunteers) RA.
[1000324000130] |Since its formation in 1967 Officers, Warrant Officers, NCOs and soldiers of 103 Regiment have volunteered and served in support of the Regular Army in Bosnia, Borneo, Belize, Canada, Kosovo, Kenya, Latvia, Iraq, Northern Ireland and Afghanistan.

[1000324000140] |In 1977 the Regiment changed its designation to 103rd (Lancashire Artillery Volunteers) Air Defence Regiment Royal Artillery (Volunteers) upon being equipped with BLOWPIPE.
[1000324000150] |Consequent upon the enhancement of the Territorial Army a Battery of Home Service Force and a fourth Air Defence Battery were raised.
