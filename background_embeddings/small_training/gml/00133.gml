[1000334400230] |Furthermore, it had its own press service, consisting of members of the Union of Polish Syndicalists.
[1000334400240] |It published two magazines - ⌊/Iskra/⌋ and ⌊/Syndykalista/⌋.

[1000334400250] |After heavy fights in the first weeks of August 1944, the Company became the best-equipped Polish unit in the area of the Old Town .
[1000334400260] |It participated in capture of the ⌊/PASTA/⌋ skyscraper and in skirmishes around ⌊>Warsaw’s Royal Castle>⌋.
[1000334400270] |Then, under pressure from the Germans, it organized defence of the Old Town, including ⌊>St. John’s Cathedral>⌋.

[1000334400280] |In the second half of August, the Company created its headquarters in the so-called ⌊/Professors’ House/⌋, at 12 Brzozowa Street, where it stayed until general retreat from the district.
[1000334400290] |During several skirmishes back then, the Company used red-black flags of ⌊>Anarcho-syndicalists>⌋, which was at odds with the Home Army’s ⌊>Military police>⌋, which demanded replacement of the flag with the Polish one and change the name of the Company into 104 Company of the Home Army.
[1000334400300] |It has been estimated that losses (KIA, MIA and WIA) of the unit reached more than 50% of its personnel .

[1000334400310] |⌊=Final days¦3=⌋
[1000334400320] |In late August of ⌊>1944>⌋ the Company, numbering only around 100 soldiers, evacuated in sewage canals to the ⌊>mid-city>⌋.
[1000334400330] |There, it became part of the ⌊/Boncza/⌋ Battalion, and took place in fighting in the district of ⌊>Powiśle>⌋, during which the Company was depleted.
[1000334400340] |Assault Platoon with 26 men managed to get to ⌊>Czerniaków>⌋, where it was engaged in heavy fighting.
[1000334400350] |In early September, parts of the company provided rearguards during the evacuation of Warsaw’s Old Town .

[1000334400360] |On September 15, 1944, three soldiers managed to get across to the eastern bank of the ⌊>Vistula>⌋, later on more men got across, where they were conscripted to the ⌊>First Polish Army>⌋.

[1000334500000] |⌊δ104th Division (United States)δ⌋
[1000334500010] |The ⌊∗104th Infantry Division∗⌋ —nicknamed the ⌊∗Timberwolf Division∗⌋— is a ⌊>division>⌋ of the ⌊>United States Army>⌋ that fought for 195 consecutive days during ⌊>World War II>⌋.
[1000334500020] |Some 34,000 men served with the division under the leadership of ⌊>General Terry Allen>⌋, who was much admired despite his nickname, "Terrible Terry".
[1000334500030] |The division's first action came in October of 1944 during the taking of ⌊>Achtmaal>⌋ and Zundert in Holland.
[1000334500040] |It then participated in the Battle of the Bulge, advanced through the Siegfried line and across the ⌊>Inde>⌋ River into Cologne, and it helped complete the encirclement of the ⌊>Ruhr pocket>⌋.
[1000334500050] |Finally, it made a 350-mile sweep to the Mulde River in the heart of Germany.
[1000334500060] |The division was particularly renowned for its night fighting prowess.

[1000334500070] |⌊=Insignia¦2=⌋
[1000334500080] |The division's nickname came from its ⌊>timberwolf>⌋ shoulder insignia.
[1000334500090] |The division insignia is a gray Timberwolf's head on a balsam green disc.
[1000334500100] |It was designed by ⌊>Charles Livingston Bull>⌋, artist and authority on wild life, and represents the northwest.
[1000334500110] |It was in this section of the country that the 104th conducted its training in 1942-43 when it was activated (see ⌊>U. S. Army Center for Military History - 104th Infantry Division>⌋).

[1000334500230] |⌊=History¦2=⌋
[1000334500240] |The 104th Infantry Division landed in France on ⌊>September 7>⌋, ⌊>1944>⌋ .
[1000334500250] |It is likely that the division was initially involved with implementing the ⌊>Red Ball Express>⌋.

[1000334500260] |⌊=With Canadian First Army, in the ⌊>Battle of the Scheldt>⌋¦3=⌋
[1000334500270] |The 104th's first combat experience occurred during the latter portions of the ⌊>Battle of the Scheldt>⌋.
[1000334500280] |While attached to the ⌊>Canadian 1st Army>⌋, the division moved into defensive positions in the vicinity of ⌊>Wuustwezel>⌋, ⌊>Belgium>⌋, on ⌊>October 23>⌋, ⌊>1944>⌋, and went over to the offensive on the 25th, taking Zundert and ⌊>Achtmaal>⌋, gaining control of the Breda-Roosendaal Road (see ⌊>map>⌋), and overrunning Vaart Canal defenses.
[1000334500290] |⌊>Leur and Etten>⌋ fell as the division advanced to the ⌊>Mark River>⌋ on ⌊>October 31>⌋.
[1000334500300] |A coordinated attack over the Mark River at Standaarbuiten (part of ⌊>Moerdijk>⌋ municipality), on ⌊>November 2>⌋, ⌊>1944>⌋, established a ⌊>bridgehead>⌋.
[1000334500310] |⌊>Zevenbergen>⌋ was captured and the Maas River reached on ⌊>November 5>⌋.

[1000334500320] |⌊=With VII Corps, in the ⌊>Battle of Hurtgen Forest>⌋¦3=⌋
[1000334500330] |After release by the First Canadian Army, on ⌊>November 6>⌋ the 104th began moving by motor convoy towards ⌊>Aachen>⌋, Germany (see ⌊>map>⌋).
[1000334500340] |The ⌊>414th Regimental Combat Team>⌋ remained behind temporarily to secure ⌊>Moerdijk>⌋.
[1000334500350] |On ⌊>November 8>⌋, the division started its relief of the U.S. 1st Infantry Division in the vicinity of Aachen, and it became attached by the ⌊>VII Corps>⌋, ⌊>First Army>⌋.

[1000334500360] |The 104th participated in the northern edge of what is now called the ⌊>Battle of Hurtgen Forest>⌋.
[1000334500370] |The abstract of a ⌊>Defense Technical Information Center>⌋ report, "Huertgen Forest: Offensive, Deliberate Attack, Forest, 16 November 1944", describes what happened as follows: "The VII (US) Corps, 1st Army attacked 16 November 1944 with 1st Inf Div, 4th Inf Div, 104th Inf Div, and CCR 5th AD to clear Huertgen Forest and the path of 1st Army to the ⌊>Roer>⌋ River.
[1000334500380] |After heavy fighting, primarily by the 4th Infantry Division, VII Corps' attack ground to a halt.
[1000334500390] |V Corps was committed on 21 November 1944.
[1000334500400] |Attacking with 8th Inf Div, and CCR 5th AD, the V Corps managed to capture Huertgen after stiff fighting on 28 November 1944."

[1000334500410] |While the 4th Infantry Division was being stalled by dug-in defenders deep within the ⌊>Hurtgen Forest>⌋, the 104th Infantry Division attacked and secured ⌊>Stolberg>⌋ on ⌊>November 16>⌋.
[1000334500420] |Pushing on against heavy resistance, the 104th division was able to take ⌊>Eschweiler>⌋ on the ⌊>November 21>⌋.
[1000334500430] |The division next cleared the area west of the ⌊>Inde River>⌋, including ⌊>Inden>⌋, in vicious fighting.

[1000334500440] |⌊=With VII Corps,¦3=⌋
[1000334500450] |Despite strong enemy counterattacks in the vicinity of Lamersdorf, Inden and Lucherberg (see ⌊>map>⌋) in early December, by ⌊>December 23>⌋ the 104th and its attached units had completed a hard-fought, town-by-town drive beyond the Siegfried Line to the ⌊>Roer River>⌋.
[1000334500460] |From ⌊>December 15>⌋, ⌊>1944>⌋ to ⌊>February 22>⌋, ⌊>1945>⌋ (Note: Unit was not in the Battle of the Bulge), the 104th was involved with defending its sector near ⌊>Düren>⌋ and Merken (see ⌊>map>⌋).

[1000334500470] |⌊=Drive to Cologne¦3=⌋
[1000334500480] |As the German offensive in the Ardennes wound down, the division moved across the ⌊>Roer>⌋ and took Huchem-Stammeln, Birkesdorf, and North ⌊>Duren>⌋.
[1000334500490] |On ⌊>March 5>⌋, it entered ⌊>Cologne>⌋ after heavy fighting (see ⌊>map>⌋).
[1000334500500] |This ⌊>archive>⌋ from the 750th Tank Battalion elaborates on actions involved in the approach to Cologne.

[1000334500510] |⌊=Encirclement of the Ruhr pocket¦3=⌋
[1000334500520] |After defending the west bank of the ⌊>Rhine>⌋, the division crossed the river at ⌊>Honnef>⌋ on ⌊>March 22>⌋, ⌊>1945>⌋, and attacked to the east of the ⌊>Remagen>⌋ bridgehead.
[1000334500530] |General Collins’ VII Corps (First Army) was given the assignment of encircling the important Ruhr industrial area of Germany from the south.
[1000334500540] |Beginning early on ⌊>March 25>⌋, the 3rd Armored Division, with the 104th's 414th Infantry Regiment attached, began a lightning-like thrust eastward.
[1000334500550] |After 9 days, the 3rd Armored and 414th Infantry had completed a 193-mile dash to Paderborn, and at Lippstadt, they linked up with the U.S. Ninth Army to complete the encirclement of the ⌊>Ruhr>⌋ pocket (see ⌊>map>⌋), thus trapping 335,000 German troops.
[1000334500560] |During this offensive, the 3rd Armored advanced in four columns on more or less parallel roads.
[1000334500570] |The remainder of the 104th Infantry Division, mounted on trucks and accompanied by the 750th Tank Battalion and other supporting troops, had the job of mopping up enemy forces bypassed by the 3rd Armored.
[1000334500580] |In many cases, these bypassed forces had recovered from the initial shock by the time the follow-up forces reached them and put up a strong defense.
[1000334500590] |The 104th repulsed heavy attacks near ⌊>Medebach>⌋, and ⌊>Paderborn>⌋ was captured on ⌊>April 1>⌋, ⌊>1945>⌋.
[1000334500600] |After regrouping, the 104th advanced to the east and crossed the ⌊>Weser River>⌋ on the 8th, blocking enemy exits from the ⌊>Harz Mountains>⌋.

[1000334500610] |The rapid 3rd Armored advance created an ever-lengthening line for the 104th to defend.
[1000334500620] |The line was threatened both from German troops on the west attempting to break out of the entrapment and from enemy forces on the east.
[1000334500630] |There were many engagements all along the line.
[1000334500640] |Supply vehicles carrying much-needed fuel and other materials were frequently ambushed.
[1000334500650] |General Collins placed additional divisions in the ever-lengthening line to contain the Germans.
[1000334500660] |Ultimately there were five infantry divisions, plus a cavalry group, stretched over a 175-mile arc from Remagen to Paderborn.
[1000334500670] |As the increasing seriousness of the German situation became apparent, larger and larger groups attempted (without success) to break through the American lines.
[1000334500680] |It was a very fluid situation, and it was uncertain as to when or where the enemy might be encountered (see ⌊>the 750th records>⌋).

[1000334500700] |After liberating the ⌊>Mittelbau Dora concentration camp>⌋ near Nordhausen on April 11 (see ⌊>The Journey of Private Galione, Supporting Documents>⌋), the 104th then crossed the ⌊>Saale River>⌋ and took ⌊>Halle>⌋ in a bitter 5-day struggle which lasted from ⌊>April 15>⌋ to ⌊>19>⌋ (see ⌊>map>⌋).
[1000334500710] |The sector to the ⌊>Mulde River>⌋ was cleared by the 21st, and after vigorous patrolling, the division contacted the ⌊>Red Army>⌋ at ⌊>Pretzsch>⌋ on ⌊>April 26>⌋.

[1000334600000] |⌊δ104th Field Battery, Royal Australian Artilleryδ⌋
[1000334600010] |⌊∗104 Field Battery, Royal Australian Artillery∗⌋ was formed in the town of ⌊>Moascar>⌋ in ⌊>Egypt>⌋ during March ⌊>1916>⌋ as the 104th Field Artillery (Howitzer) Battery, part of ⌊>4th Field Artillery Brigade>⌋.
[1000334600020] |The battery was disbanded, reformed and rerolled many times during its history and is now inactive.

[1000334600030] |⌊=History¦2=⌋
[1000334600040] |⌊=World War I¦3=⌋
[1000334600050] |The 104th Field Battery, Royal Regiment of Australian Artillery, had its beginnings in Egypt, in March 1916.
[1000334600060] |At this time the Battery was raised as a part of the general expansion of divisional Artillery prior to the ⌊>AIF>⌋ going to ⌊>France>⌋.
[1000334600070] |In mid-March 1916 the battery sailed for France, and upon their arrival were issued with new ⌊>4.5 inch howitzers>⌋, reunited with their horses and commenced training.
[1000334600080] |On ⌊>21 April>⌋ ⌊>1916>⌋, 104th Howitzer Battery relieved C Battery of 176 Brigade ⌊>Royal Field Artillery>⌋ (RFA) on the line south east of ⌊>Armentieres>⌋, exchanging guns in the process.
[1000334600090] |Shortly after this they deployed to ⌊>Somme>⌋ and saw their first real action on the ⌊>Western front>⌋.
[1000334600100] |After the ⌊>Third Battle of Ypres>⌋, the Battery fired in support of the ⌊>British 30th Division>⌋ and the ⌊>British 7th Brigade>⌋ in the ⌊>Battle of the Hindenburg Line>⌋.

[1000334600110] |Over the next two years 104th field battery, as part of the ⌊>2nd Division>⌋ Artillery saw intense and unrelenting action on the Western Front, with almost 58% of the total gunners deployed from ⌊>Australia>⌋ being killed.
[1000334600120] |After Victory was declared the Battery returned to Australia and was disbanded.

[1000334600130] |⌊=Vietnam War¦3=⌋
[1000334600140] |The battery served two tours of ⌊>South Vietnam>⌋; the first was from May ⌊>1968>⌋ to May ⌊>1969>⌋ as part of 12 Field Regiment, supporting ⌊>4 RAR>⌋.
[1000334600150] |On returning to Australia, the Battery regrouped in ⌊>Holsworthy>⌋, and moved up to ⌊>Townsville>⌋ in preparation for it’s second tour of ⌊>Vietnam>⌋.
[1000334600160] |The battery’s second tour was from May ⌊>1971>⌋ to December 1971, again supporting 4 RAR.
[1000334600170] |104th Field Battery was the last Australian Field Artillery unit to leave Vietnam.
[1000334600180] |On returning to Australia the Battery was located at Coral Lines ⌊>Ingleburn>⌋ with 12th Field Regiment.

[1000334600190] |⌊=Post Vietnam¦3=⌋
[1000334600200] |For a short period time the Battery participated in peacetime training and support activities, but with the formation of ⌊>8th/12th Medium Regiment>⌋, the Battery was disbanded in December ⌊>1973>⌋.
[1000334600210] |In November ⌊>1977>⌋ the Battery was re-raised as part of the 8th /12th Medium regiment with 5.5 inch guns.
[1000334600220] |Soon after the re-raising, the Battery took part in its most important peacetime action.
[1000334600230] |In February ⌊>1978>⌋, following a ⌊>bomb blast>⌋ at the ⌊>Hilton Hotel>⌋ in ⌊>Sydney>⌋, the decision was made to call in the Army to secure ⌊>Bowral>⌋, the venue for the ⌊>Commonwealth Heads of Government Meeting>⌋.
[1000334600240] |However on ⌊>15 June>⌋ ⌊>1979>⌋ the Battery was once again formally disbanded.

[1000334600250] |⌊=Recent history¦3=⌋
[1000334600260] |In October ⌊>1985>⌋ the battery was re-raised as an ⌊>Army Reserve Unit>⌋, as part of 1st Field Regiment in ⌊>Brisbane>⌋, and again issued with the 105mm ⌊>M2A2>⌋ Howitzer.
[1000334600270] |The M2A2 was replaced in October ⌊>1990>⌋, with the 105mm ⌊>L118>⌋/⌊>L119>⌋ Hamel Gun.

[1000334600280] |In January ⌊>1992>⌋ the Regiment converted to the Ready Reserve Scheme, attracting a large increase in numbers to the battery and Regiment.
[1000334600290] |The scheme involved members undertaking a contract to work full-time for 12 months, then work 50 days a year for the next four years.

[1000334600300] |In December ⌊>1996>⌋, the Ready Reserve Scheme was completed, however the Battery continued to foster Ready Reserve Soldiers until ⌊>2000>⌋, when the Battery assumed the composition that it has today, as a general reserve unit.

[1000334600310] |104 Field Battery was disbanded on 1 July 2005 during a parade held by 1 Field Regiment to retask 105 Field Battery to a Medium Battery role.
[1000334600320] |Personnel were transferred to the reserve element of 105 Medium Battery and to other batteries within the regiment.

[1000334900160] |Regiment Reveals Its Valor and Fighting Qualities in the Fierce Combats of Bois Brule.

[1000334900170] |By AMICO J. BARONE

[1000334900180] |Apremont!
[1000334900190] |The name spells horror and glory for the 104th.
[1000334900200] |In April 1918, the troops from Massachusetts achieved a distinction never before won by American troops in the entire history of our armed forces.
[1000334900210] |So valorously did they conduct themselves in the Bois Brule, a wood close to Apermont, that the French Government decorated the colors of the regiment with the Croix de Guerre.
[1000334900220] |It was the first time such an honor had ever come to an American unit.
[1000334900230] |In addition the regimental commander and 116 other officers and men had the bronze cross with its red and green ribbon pinned on their breasts.
[1000334900240] |The regimental citation read: "For greatest fighting spirit and self-sacrifice during action of April10, 12 and 13, 1918.
[1000334900250] |Suffering from heavy bombardments, and attack by very strong German Forces, the regiment succeeded in preventing their dangerous advance, and with greatest energy reconquered, at the point of bayonet, the few ruined trenches which had to be abandoned at the first onset, at the same tome making prisoners".
[1000334900260] |In a general order issued a few days after the Bois Brule engagements, the French general Passaga declared: "During this fight the American troops gave proof not only of their splendid courage, which we know, but also of a brotherhood in arms which was absolute and ever present.
[1000334900270] |With such men as these the cause of liberty is sure to triumph."

[1000334900280] |Continued below: The First American Croix de Guerre to be awarded to an entire regiment.
[1000334900290] |This Medal was also given to Captain George Roberts, and the bronze frame was specially cast with the infantry tools of the day around the frame.
[1000334900300] |The frame mold was broke and never reproduced to be one of a kind.
[1000334900310] |The picture is Colonel George A. Roberts, Commander of the 104th Infantry Westfield Massachusetts.
[1000334900320] |The 104th is now the 104th Tactical Fighter Wing, Barnes Air National Guard Base.
[1000334900330] |Westfield MA.

[1000334900340] |Continued: Bois Brule was in La Reine sector on the southeasterly face of the St. Mihiel salient, a rough and ragged terrain where virtually all the tactical advantage lay with the enemy.
[1000334900350] |In 1914 the sector had seen violent fighting, but as the war of attrition developed, it became moderately quiet with a sort of tacit understanding between the opposing forces to permit the situation to remain unchanged.
[1000334900360] |The town of Apremont, whose name will be forever linked up with the 104th Regiment, lay outside the Allied lines.
[1000334900370] |In the distance, grim and desolate Mont Sec loomed up as a splendid vantage point from which the enemy could observe the American positions.
[1000334900380] |Difficult Spot to Defend.

[1000334900390] |The 26th Division took over the sector the first of April, the left of the line being assigned to the 104th.
[1000334900400] |On the immediate left of the Western Massachusetts outfit was the 10th Colonial French Division.
[1000334900410] |The regiments sub sector in the Bois Brule formed an awkward, narrow salient, hard to defend.
[1000334900420] |The trenches were in poor condition, there was inadequate protection against shelling, and the marshy land made trench drainage difficult.
[1000334900430] |The third battalion of the 104th, under command of Capt. George A. Roberts of Springfield, MA., immediately went into the forward position.
[1000334900440] |The battalion commander, noting the small salient extending out and realizing how simple it would be for the enemy to pinch in on it and make prisoners of the men holding the position, asked and received permission to straighten out the line.
[1000334900450] |K Co., under the command of First Lieutenant George Hosmer of Springfield, MA., performed this operation successfully.
[1000334900460] |For some unaccountable reason, the French had persisted in maintaining the small and unimportant salient and had often lost prisoners to the enemy who would come over and successfully pinch it out.
[1000334900470] |During the first three of four days the outfit held the sector, it was subjected to a harassing enemy fire.
[1000334900480] |On April 5th the shelling grew in intensity and for the following four days the area was severely pounded by the enemy artillery.
[1000334900490] |Evidently, an action was impending and the Germans were bent on shaking the moral of the troops by the concentration of shells.

[1000334900500] |Early on the morning of the 10th, the enemy blasting became particularly severe.
[1000334900510] |The huge projectiles from the German minenwerfers came thundering down on the positions held by the third Battalion, shattering trenches and subjecting the men to terrific punishment.
[1000334900520] |Capt. Roberts sent back word that help was needed to evacuate the wounded and suggested that the bandsmen be used as stretcher bearers.
[1000334900530] |The suggestion was acted upon and the valiant work these men did under fire won for several of their number decorations from the French and American Governments. ..As the dawn crept over Bois Brule on April 10th, the enemy troops made their appearance on the front held by the 3rd Battalion - a hillcrest.
[1000334900540] |They came on relentlessly, but that assault wave of storm troops failed to dislodge the men of Western Massachusetts.
[1000334900550] |It was a severe test of arms in which much technique of warfare was forgotten by the green Yanks who nevertheless battled vigorously and effectively to beat back the veteran enemy.

[1000334900560] |The artillery fire also was of great aid in stemming that first tide.
[1000334900570] |Thus for the moment the 3rd Battalion had checked the attack on the night of the 11th despite heavy enemy shelling, the second Battalion came in to relieve the 3rd which had held the position for 10 days.
[1000334900580] |On the 12th the enemy came over again with renewed energy.
[1000334900590] |This time the French on the American's left fell back, exposing the left flank of the Yanks.
[1000334900600] |But the Americans rose to this emergency and by a vigorous counter-attack, driving back remnants of enemy groups.

[1000334900610] |Gives Credit To Men By the 13th the affair of Bois Brule was over and the 104th had conclusively demonstrated that it could withstand the attack of seasoned troops.
[1000334900620] |The men had revealed courage and resourcefulness and the officers had shown real leadership under trying conditions.
[1000334900630] |A day or two later Capt. Roberts was promoted to the rank of major for the splendid manner in which he had handled his battalion.
[1000334900640] |An incident characteristic of his modesty occurred at that time.
[1000334900650] |The divisional commander, Gen. Edwards drove up to battalion headquarters and seeing Capt. Roberts he called him over to congratulate him.
[1000334900660] |Capt. Roberts said: "The credit belongs to the men of the battalion, General, not to me."
[1000334900670] |The General answered: "You would say that."
[1000334900680] |On April 28th, the regiment was lined up at Bocq, not far from where it had demonstrated its mettle, and there Gen. Passaga decorated the colors of the outfit and scores of men and officers with the Croix de Guerre.
[1000334900690] |His voice trembling with emotion, the French officer pinned the red and green ribbons to the 104th colors, saying: "I am proud to decorate the flag of a regiment which has shown such fortitude and courage."

[1000334900700] |It was a great day for the men of Massachusetts.
[1000334900710] |Capt. Roberts was among those decorated with the French cross.
[1000334900720] |He was also recommended for the American Distinguished Serviced Cross.
[1000334900730] |Later, in the Bouconville sector, he was slightly wounded and in July he was transferred to provost marshal duty in Lanon.

[1000336600000] |⌊δ105 mm Howitzer M3δ⌋
[1000336600010] |The ⌊∗105 mm Howitzer M3∗⌋ was a ⌊>U.S.>⌋ light ⌊>howitzer>⌋ designed for use by airborne troops.
[1000336600020] |The gun utilized a barrel of the ⌊>105 mm Howitzer M2>⌋, shortened and fitted to a slightly modified split trail carriage of the ⌊>75 mm pack howitzer>⌋.

[1000336600030] |The howitzer was used by ⌊>US Army>⌋ during the ⌊>Second World War>⌋.
[1000336600040] |It was issued to airborne units and to cannon ⌊>companies>⌋ of infantry ⌊>regiment>⌋s.

[1000336600050] |⌊=Development and production¦2=⌋
[1000336600060] |The process of building airborne forces led in 1941 to a requirement for an air portable 105 mm howitzer.
[1000336600070] |The weapon, initially designated T7, featured a ⌊>barrel>⌋ of ⌊>105mm Howitzer M2>⌋, shortened by ⌊λ27 inches (690 mm)¦27¦in¦mm¦Convertλ⌋ and combined with recoil system and carriage of the ⌊>75 mm field howitzer>⌋.
[1000336600080] |A prototype reached trials at ⌊>Aberdeen Proving Ground>⌋ in March 1942.

[1000336600090] |The howitzer was designed to fire the same ammunition as the longer M2.
[1000336600100] |It turned out, however, that shorter barrel resulted in incomplete burning of the propelling charge.
[1000336600110] |The problem could be solved by use of faster burning powder.
[1000336600120] |Otherwise the design was considered acceptable and was standardized as ⌊∗105mm Howitzer M3 on Carriage M3∗⌋.
[1000336600130] |The carriage was soon succeeded by M3A1, which had trails made from thicker plate.
[1000336600140] |Even stronger tubular trails were designed, but never reached production.

[1000336600150] |The production started in February 1943 and continued until May 1944; an additional bunch was produced in April-June 1945.

[1000336600160] |⌊=Service¦2=⌋
[1000336600170] |Even though the M3 was not mentioned in Tables of Organization and Equipment (TO&E) of February 1944, shortly before the Normandy Airdrops some airborne divisions received 105 mm ⌊>glider>⌋ field artillery ⌊>battalion>⌋, in addition to three ⌊>75 mm howitzer>⌋ battalions.
[1000336600180] |⌊>1/4 ton jeep>⌋s were used as ⌊>prime mover>⌋s.
[1000336600190] |The weapon was finally authorized as an option by the December 1944 TO&E and, by 1945, employed by all airborne divisions in the ⌊>European Theater>⌋.

[1000336600200] |The M3 was also issued to cannon ⌊>companies>⌋ of infantry ⌊>regiment>⌋s (six , in three platoons of two).
[1000336600210] |Infantry typically used 1 1/2 ton truck as prime mover.

[1000336600220] |A small number of M3 were supplied via ⌊>lend lease>⌋ channels to ⌊>France>⌋ (94), ⌊>United Kingdom>⌋ (2) and countries of ⌊>Latin America>⌋ (18).

[1000336600270] |Carriage variants:

[1000336600310] |⌊=Self-propelled mounts¦2=⌋
[1000336600320] |There were two proposals for a self-propelled artillery piece armed with the M3.
[1000336600330] |Neither reached mass production.

[1000336600340] |⌊•⌊#105 mm Howitzer Motor Carriage T38 - based on the ⌊>M3 halftrack>⌋, never built.#⌋
[1000336600350] |⌊#105 mm Howitzer Motor Carriage T82 (M3 in mount M3A1) - based on the ⌊>Light Tank M5A1>⌋ chassis.
[1000336600360] |Two pilots were built.
[1000336600370] |The project was cancelled in June 1945 due to lack of requirement.#⌋•⌋

[1000336600380] |⌊=Ammunition¦2=⌋
[1000336600390] |The gun fired semi-fixed ammunition, similar to the ammunition of the ⌊>M2>⌋; it used the same projectiles and the same 105 mm Cartridge Case M14, but with different propelling charge.
[1000336600400] |The latter used faster burning powder to avoid incomplete burning; it consisted of base charge and four increments, forming five charges from 1 (the smallest) to 5 (the largest).
[1000336600410] |Firing M1 HE rounds prepared for the M2 was authorized in an emergency, but only with charges from 1 to 3.
[1000336600420] |M1 HE rounds for the M3 could be fired from M2 with any charge.

[1000336600430] |HEAT M67 Shell had non-adjustable propelling charge.
[1000336600440] |For blank ammunition, a shorter Cartridge Case M15 with black powder charge was used.

[1000339700070] |Roy Wood suggested adding number eight to fit the melody better.
[1000339700080] |The song was still to be a new song by ⌊>The Move>⌋, until Wood added some ⌊>cello>⌋ riffs and after many cello layers were added using ⌊>overdubbing>⌋, the 'Overture' and the ⌊>Electric Light Orchestra>⌋ were born.
[1000339700090] |It was during the singles chart run that Roy Wood dramatically exited the ELO line up and returned later in the year with yet another new band called ⌊>Wizzard>⌋.

[1000339700100] |The song was covered by ⌊>Bobby Sutcliff>⌋ and ⌊>Mitch Easter>⌋ in ⌊>2001>⌋, by ⌊>Parthenon Huxley>⌋ in 2005 and by ⌊>Def Leppard>⌋ in ⌊>2006>⌋.

[1000339700110] |In March ⌊>2007>⌋ the song was used in the closing credits of an episode of ⌊>Life on Mars>⌋.

[1000339700120] |An almost identical opening riff can be heard in the song "The Changingman" by ⌊>Paul Weller>⌋, which also seems to recreate the beginning of "In Old England Town (instrumental) from the b side of the single Showdown in the UK.

[1000339700140] |⌊""10538 Overture was an idea that Jeff (Lynne) brought along to the studio which was originally to be a Move track.
[1000339700150] |After recording the basic backing track, the other guys went home, leaving Jeff and myself to run riot with the overdubs.
[1000339700160] |At the time, I was very keen on collecting instruments, and had just acquired a cheap Chinese cello.
[1000339700170] |After we had finished overdubbing the guitars, I sat in the control room trying out this cello and sort of messing around with Jimi Hendrix type riffs.
[1000339700180] |Jeff said, 'That sounds great, why don't we throw it on the track.'
[1000339700190] |I ended up recording around fifteen of these, and as the instrumentation built up, it was beginning to sound like some monster heavy metal orchestra.
[1000339700200] |In fact, it sounded just Bloody Marvellous."

[1000339700220] |⌊"I had this guitar track, like a real big riff on a guitar.
[1000339700230] |I laid it down in the studio and Roy Wood got his cello, his Chinese cello, and he overdubbed about fifteen cello riffs, just double tracking all the time-- and it sounded fantastic.
[1000339700240] |We thought, it was like 'Wow!' and we just sat round playing it for days.
