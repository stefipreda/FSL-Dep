105P/Singer Brewster is a periodic comet in our solar system.
Its name is unusual: co-discovered comets bear the names of the co-discoverers linked by hyphens (e.g., Shoemaker-Levy 9, Helin-Roman-Alu 1, Swift-Tuttle, etc.).
But the single discoverer in this case bears a hyphenated name (Stephen Singer-Brewster), so the comet's name replaces the hyphen by a space.


105mm Gun T8 was an anti-tank gun developed in the United States in mid 1940s.
The development started in October 1944; the gun reached trials in February 1946.
Soon afterwards the project was cancelled.

Two pilot pieces were built; one of those is on display in the United States Army Ordnance Museum, Aberdeen, Maryland, United States.

The T8 weighted about eight tons.
It had split trail carriage and magnesium wheels with synthetic rubber tires.
In transportation, the mount could be rotated 180 degrees in order to reduce the length of the piece.

The gun fired a 17.7 kg (39 lbs) AP projectile at 945 m/s (3,100 ft/s), resulting in the penetration of 210 mm (8.26 in) at 1,000 m (1,093 yds), 0 degrees.

The 105th Armored Division is a military formation of the Korean People's Army.
It was North Korea's first armored unit and took part in the Korean War.


The division was established in October 1948 as the "105th Armored Battalion" and increased to regimental strength in May 1949.
By June 1950, the "105th Armored Regiment" had become the 105th Armored Brigade with a strength of 6,000 men and 120 T-34 tanks.
Its equipment-tanks, weapons, and vehicles-was Russian-made.

The brigade had three tank regiments - the 107th, the 109th and 203rd - and a mechanized infantry regiment, the 206th.
The 83d Motorized Regiment was also part of the division during the Korean War. .

Each tank regiment had three medium tank battalions, each having 13 tanks.
Each tank battalion had three tank companies with 4 tanks to a company.
Tank crews consisted of five men.
Battalion, regimental, and division tank commanders each had a personal tank.
The mechanised infantry regiment had a strength of about 2,500 men.

The 105th Armored Brigade was raised to division status in Seoul at the end of June 1950 before it crossed the Han River to continue the attack southward.


During the Korean War, it was part of the North Korean advance from Seoul to Taejon and subsequent Battle of Pusan Perimeter between August and September 1950.

At the end of October and the first week of November 1950, the 105th Armored Division, partly reconstituted since the Naktong battles, was committed to help the Chinese and did so with tank fire in a few instances, but it played a negligible role in the fighting.
The U.S. Fifth Air Force destroyed most of its tanks back of the battle front.
On November 7, for instance, U.N. aircraft reportedly destroyed 6 tanks, 3 armored cars, and 45 vehicles in Pakchon and the area eastward.


In military terms, 105th Division may refer to:



105th Infantry Division (German Empire)


105th Armored Division (North Korea)


The 105th Infantry Division (105. Infanterie-Division) was a unit of the Imperial German Army in World War I. The division was formed on May 5, 1915 and organized over the next few weeks.
It was part of a wave of new infantry divisions formed in the spring of 1915.
The division was disbanded in 1919 during the demobilization of the German Army after World War I.

The division was formed primarily from the excess infantry regiments of existing divisions which were being triangularized.
The division's 209th Infantry Brigade was formerly the 69th Infantry Brigade of the 36th Infantry Division, and came to the division with the 129th Infantry Regiment.
The 21st Infantry Regiment came from the 35th Infantry Division and the 122nd Füsilier Regiment came from the 26th Infantry Division.
The 21st and 129th Infantry Regiments were raised in West Prussia.
The 122nd Füsilier Regiment was from the Kingdom of Württemberg, and was later replaced by the 400th Infantry Regiment, raised primarily in the Rhineland.


The 105th Infantry Division initially served on the Eastern Front, seeing its first action in the Gorlice-Tarnów Offensive.
It was then transferred south to participate in the Serbian Campaign.
It advanced to the Greek border and remained on the Macedonian front until June 1916.
Elements of the division were detached and sent to Bulgaria during this period.
The division was sent back to Galicia in June in response to the Russian Brusilov Offensive.
In September, the division went to Latvia, and fought near Riga and Jakobstadt (now Jēkabpils).
At the end of October 1917, the division was sent to the Western Front, entering the line in the German "Siegfried" position.
It fought in the tank Battle of Cambrai in November 1917 and in the German counterattack in December.
In April 1918, the division participated in the German Spring Offensive, fighting in the First Battle of the Somme (1918), also known as the Second Battle of the Somme (to distinguish it from the 1916 battle).
It remained in the Somme salient and fought against various Allied counteroffensives.
The division moved to the St. Mihiel salient in September and then occupied the line in the Woëvre region.
In October, it met the Allied Meuse-Argonne Offensive.
The division remained in the line until the end of the war.
Allied intelligence rated the division as third class.


The division underwent relatively few organizational changes over the course of the war.
The 122nd Füsilier Regiment, a Württemberg unit, was replaced by the Prussian 400th Infantry Regiment.
Cavalry was reduced, artillery and signals commands were formed, and combat engineer support was expanded to a full pioneer battalion.
The order of battle on June 16, 1918 was as follows:

209.Infanterie-Brigade
Infanterie-Regiment von Borcke (4. Pommersches) Nr.

The 105th Medium Battery is a unit of the Royal Regiment of Australian Artillery that can trace its history back to March 1916 when it was raised as 105th Howitzer Battery in Egypt.

The Battery is based at Gallipoli Barracks, Enoggera, Queensland, as a full-time, regular army unit and is one of three batteries that make up the 1st Field Regiment, part of 7 Brigade.


The 105th Howitzer Battery was raised in March 1916 in Egypt as a part of the 22nd Howitzer Brigade, following a decision to equip each infantry division with a Howitzer Brigade, and shortly thereafter embarked for Marseilles, France.


By 11 May 1916, the Battery joined 13th, 14th and 15th Batteries at Fleurbiax, France (near Armentieres) to form 5th Field Brigade Australian Field Artillery of 2nd Division Artillery, after a reorganisation of the artillery saw each field brigade having 12 x 18 pounders and 4 x  howitzers.
The Howitzer Brigades then became Field Artillery Brigades also, seeing the 105th Howitzer Battery become the 105th Field Artillery (Howitzer) Battery.

In January 1917, batteries were increased in size from four to six guns each in order to economise on battery and brigade commanders.

The Battery was disbanded following cessation of hostilities on 30 March 1919.


Following a restructure of the Citizen's Army, based on the framework of the 1st AIF, in 1921, the 105th Field (Howitzer) Battery was re-raised, along with the rest of the 5th Field Regiment, except for 15th Battery, which wasn't re-raised until 1938.
The Battery was based at Gona Barracks at Kelvin Grove, Queensland at this time.

During the ensuing years prior to World War II, the Battery conducted several training camps around Brisbane.
The Battery embarked on their first annual training camp, held on the southern shores of the Brisbane River at Lytton in 1927.

During 1930, two training camps were conducted.
The first commenced on 4 April at Enoggera, with the second, commencing on 30 June, being conducted at Lytton.
A training camp during March 1931 was conducted at Bellevue Station, near Ipswich.
At this time, the Battery was still using horses for transportation of personnel and its guns.

A new artillery range was opened by Assistant Minister for Defence Mr J. Francis in September 1934 at Mound Walker (near Rosewood).
The Battery trekked  to attend the opening of the new range, as well as conduct a joint exercise with the 111th Battery.
This exercise was held annually until 1939, when the Caloundra Range was established on a beach  to the north of Brisbane.

During the 1937 exercises, cars and utilities were used for transportation by Battery staff, with other Battery personnel utilising horses.
The introduction of Fordson Gun Tractors in 1938 saw the Battery's guns being towed by the tractors, with the staff reverting to riding horses.
The Battery was fully mechanised from November 1939.

The Battery was again disbanded in December 1940, with members of the 5th Field Regiment amalgamating to form the newly raised 2nd/5th Field Regiment.
This unit was later re-designated 2nd/1st Anti Tank Regiment.


The Battery was re-raised on 1 July 1955 as an independent battery of 1st Field Regiment at Holsworthy Barracks.
Shortly thereafter, the Battery was deployed on a tour of Malaya, lasting from September 1955 to June 1957.

The Battery remained as a unit of the 1st Field Regiment until 1960, when the Battery moved to Sanananda Barracks, Wacol to become a founding member of 4th Field Regiment.


The Battery was involved in two tours of Vietnam.
The first from 14 September 1965 to October 1966.
It was during this tour, on 18 August 1966, that the Battery was involved in the Battle of Long Tan.

The second and last tour of Vietnam lasted from February 1969 to March 1970.

In 1976, the Battery detached from the 4th Field Regiment and moved to its current home at Gallipoli Barracks, Enoggera to join 1st Field Regiment.


On 1 July 2005, after 50 years of continuous service as a field battery, 105th Battery's 105mm L119 Hamels were replaced with 155mm M198 Howitzers, with the Battery being re-raised as 105th Medium Battery on 2 July 2005.


The 105th Military Police Company is a United States Army Military Police in the New York Army National Guard in the 53rd Troop Command.
The company will be joining the newly created 102nd Military Police Battalion in September 2009.
The unit served in SFOR 6 the NATO mission in Bosnia in 1999 and 2000, the World Trade Center disaster on September 11, 2001 and in Operation Iraqi Freedom in 2003 at FOB Kalsu.


The 105th MP Co was activated on February 10, 2003 and served in Iraq from April 2003 until April 2004.
The commanding officer of the unit was CPT Michael Fowler.
While in Iraq it served under the 220th Military Police Brigade and the 504th Military Police Battalion and established FOB Kalsu in Iskandaria, Iraq, 20 Miles south of Baghdad.
The unit suffered two soldiers killed in action:
*Sergeant Heath A. McMillan was killed on July 27, 2003 by IED
*Specialist Michael L. Williams was killed on October 17, 2003 by IED.


The 105th Pennsylvania Volunteer Infantry, also known as the "Wildcat Regiment" was an infantry regiment that served in the Union Army during the American Civil War.



The 105th was raised mainly in the counties of Jefferson, Clarion, and Clearfield.
It was organized at Pittsburgh in September and October 1861, and mustered into the U. S. service for a three-year term.
Among the early recruits was future United States Congressman Albert C. Thompson.

The regiment was ordered to Washington in October and assigned to the 1st Brigade, 1st Division, III Corps, in Camp Jameson (on the farm of American Revolution patriot George Mason), near Alexandria.

Leaving camp on March 17, 1862, the regiment took part in the siege of Yorktown and the battles of Williamsburg and Fair Oaks.
In the latter engagement, the troops fought like veterans, holding their position unsupported until nearly surrounded.
Three companies were on special duty at the opening of the action and, being unable to reach the regiment in its exposed position, fought with the 57th Pennsylvania.
After a month spent on picket duty, the 105th was again in action at Glendale and Malvern Hill, and, by the time it reached Harrison's Landing, the ranks were so reduced by wounds and sickness that less than 100 men were fit for active duty.

While posted along the railroad between Manassas and Warrenton Junction, companies B, G and H were captured by the Confederates.
The 1st and Hooker's divisions were engaged at Bristoe Station on August 29.
The following day, the entire army was in action at Second Bull Run, where once more the gallant work of the 105th resulted in significant losses.
The regiment was specially complimented by Maj. Gen. Philip Kearny for its gallantry.
September and October were spent at Washington.
The command left the nation's capital on October 28, and, after some scouting near Leesburg, arrived at Falmouth on November 24.
The 105th's next battle was at Fredericksburg, after which it spent the winter in camp near Brandy Station.


At the Battle of Chancellorsville in May 1863, the troops were warmly engaged, and many won the Kearny Medal of Honor (the Kearny Cross).
The first two weeks of June were spent at Banks Ford, and then the troops started northward.
At the Battle of Gettysburg, the regiment lost many men, and, after the return to Virginia, engagements followed at Auburn, Kelly's Ford, and Locust Grove in the Mine Run campaign late in November.
At the end of that campaign, the regiment returned to the camp at Brandy Station for the winter, and, on December 28, 1863, nearly the entire regiment re-enlisted.

The regiment fought at the battles of the Wilderness and Spotsylvania in May 1864 and then moved to Petersburg with the army, where it took part in the operations of the X Corps in August and the movements upon the Weldon Railroad in October and December.
On September 5, the remainder of the 63rd was added to the regiment.


On February 20, 1865, the 105th absorbed Company C of the 2nd United States Volunteer Sharpshooter Regiment, which as disbanded on that date, and in March 1865, about 300 new recruits were received.
At Sailor's Creek, the 105th was actively engaged, after which it returned to Alexandria.
It participated in the Grand Review at Washington and was mustered out in that city on July 11, 1865.

Out of a total enrollment of 2,040, the regiment lost 309 men by death from wounds or disease, and 199 soldiers were reported as missing.


105th Regiment Royal Artillery (Volunteers) The Scottish & Ulster Gunners is a British Territorial Army (TA) Regiment of the Royal Artillery. The regiment is part of 51st (Scottish) Brigade (and, to a degree, previously the 107th (Ulster) Brigade, but now the 38th for elements based in Ulster) and is currently equipped with the L118 Light Gun, which includes the famous One O'Clock Gun at Edinburgh Castle.
Prior to 2006, the regiment had an air defence role, using the Starstreak missile.


The Unit consists of a Regimental Headquarters and three Artillery batteries, based throughout Scotland and Northern Ireland.

Four regiments of the British Army have been numbered the 105th Regiment of Foot:

105th Regiment of Foot (Queen's Own Royal Regiment of Highlanders), raised in 1760
105th Regiment of Foot, raised in America and placed on the British establishment as the 105th Foot in 1782
105th Regiment of Foot, raised in 1784 and disbanded in 1785
105th Regiment of Foot (Madras Light Infantry), raised by the East India Company and placed on the British establishment as the 105th Foot in 1862


The 105th Regiment of Foot (Madras Light Infantry) was an infantry regiment of the British Army from 1862 to 1881, when it was amalgamated into The King's Own Light Infantry (South Yorkshire Regiment).

The regiment was originally raised by the Honourable East India Company in 1839 as the 2nd Madras (European) Regiment, redesignated the 2nd Madras (European) Light Infantry in 1842, and served in the Indian Mutiny of 1857.
As with all other "European" units of the Company, they were placed under the command of the Crown in 1858, and formally moved into the British Army in 1862, ranked as the 105th Foot.

As part of the Cardwell Reforms in 1881, the regiment was amalgamated with the 51st (the 2nd Yorkshire West Riding) or King's Own Light Infantry Regiment to form The King's Own Light Infantry (South Yorkshire Regiment).

106 & Park: BET's Top 10 Live is a top-ten video countdown airing weekdays on BET.
It is the network's #1 rated show.
This show was created in 2000 to fill the void left by BET music video series such as Video Soul (1983-1997), Unreal, and Planet Groove (1996-1999).


106 & Park is a 90-minute countdown music video show that features popular hip hop, contemporary R&B, reggae and dancehall music videos.
106 & Park was originally produced in Harlem, New York, and the title was derived from the original studio location, East 106th Street and Park Avenue.
Viacom's acquisition of BET prompted a change in venue to the CBS Broadcast Center at 524 West 57th Street, in the Hell's Kitchen section of Manhattan.
On March 30, 2007, Rocsi and Terrence announced that 106 & Park was the number 1 video show in the world.
Also, on June 6, 2007, Terrence announced that the series will now begin airing in Japan.
Photos from the press conference in Japan can be seen on the show's official website.


The program plays the top ten most requested videos of the day, as requested by viewers who can vote by telephone or online.
In addition to the music video countdown, a typical show also airs one new music video known as the New Joint of the Day and a music video from the past known as the Flashback Joint of the Day.


Every Friday, there is a special segment called Freestyle Friday.
The format has two rappers compete in a freestyle battle before the studio audience and three celebrity judges (On certain cases the DJ was also the judge).
Each rapper has two 30 second round to freestyle.
The rappers are not allowed to use profanities or sexually suggestive lyrics (if they do, they get disqualified).
After the battle, the judges decide the winner.
Any rapper who is able to win seven consecutive weeks is immortalized in the Freestyle Friday Hall of Fame.
The first rapper to make it this far was Shaheed the Poster Boy.
The popular segment has spawned the career of Jin and given a few other rappers the opportunity to get a record deal.


Until July 28, 2005, the show was hosted by BET personalities Free and A. J. Calloway for five years.
On August 1, 2005, BET temporarily replaced rapper Free and A. J. Calloway with two other popular BET personalities, Tigger (former host of Rap City and BET Style) and Julissa Bermudez (former host of BET's The Center).
On July 10, 2006, they were replaced by Rocsi and Terrence J who were winners from the previous year's BET New Faces Contest.

106.1 Rock Radio is a radio station based in Manchester, broadcasting peak-time news and talk output and a variety of rock music in other times.
It is Manchester's first classic rock station and it launched on 6th May 2008.

The parent company GMG owns the local newspaper Manchester Evening News, a series of local newspapers, a city-wide terrestrial and national satellite TV station Channel M and the two regional licences for North West - Century FM and Smooth Radio.

In the bid document the company promoted its capacity to operate a "quad-media" newsroom in the new headquarters of the Evening News, which would provide Rock Talk's news but be editorially independent.
