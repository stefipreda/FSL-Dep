The 101st Intelligence Squadron is a unit of the Massachusetts Air National Guard.
It was formed at Kelly Field in Texas in 1921.
Its parent unit is the 102nd Intelligence Wing.



The 101st Aero Squadron was formed as Kelly Field in 1917.
While deployed to France during World War I, it was renamed the 639th Aero Squadron.
It came back to the United States in 1919.
The 101st Observation Squadron was formed in the spring of 1921, the squadron being federally recognized on November 18th.
The 639th Aero Squadron was merged into it during this creation.
It was part of the 26th Infantry Division.
Originally, it did not receive its own JN-4D Jenny aircraft for over a year.
The original home for the 101st was Jeffery Field, a small field with two cinder runways.
The 101st actually had to raise $15,000 so that it could complete the runways.
Nevertheless, the 101st drilled weekly and Jennies were always available for pilots to fly.
The 101st additionally raised public awareness of military aviation throughout New England through its actions.
Jennies were flown at air shows, county fairs and other events.
In addition, the 101st attended two-week summer camps.
Pilots flew their Curtiss O-11s to temporary fields on Cape Cod while ground crews followed in trucks.
One of these fields was Cape Cod Airport.
In 1933, the 101st occupied new hangers and administrative buildings at Logan Airport.
The 101st was ordered into state service in 1936 and 1938 during a devastating flood and hurricane to fly observation missions and to drop food and equipment to stranded fishermen and the residents of Isle au Haut, Maine.
The 101st helped gained fame when it played a big part in the U.S. Army Air Service's flight around the world.
It then cared for the Spirit of St. Louis when Charles Lindbergh visited the state.


In 1940, the 101st was the 101st separated from the 26th Infantry Division and in November was ordered into active Federal service for intensive training.
Initially the 101st’s 25 officers and 133 enlisted men remained at home station until July 31 1941 when it was then moved from Logan Airport to Otis Field at Camp Edwards.
Otis Field was named in after 1st Lt Frank J. Otis, Jr., MD, a 101st flight surgeon who killed in a flight accident in 1938.
The 101st participated in the North Carolina maneuvers in the fall of 1941 and returned to Otis Field on December 6 1941.
With the outbreak of World War II, the 101st was assigned to fly anti-submarine patrols off the coast of New England until September 10 1942.
By then many of its original members has been reassigned during the expansion of the Army Air Forces.
During the next two years, the 101st was transferred to several bases and on 20 May 1944 had its mission changed when it was re designated as the 39th Photo Reconnaissance Squadron.
It was then placed under the command of the Ninth Air Force.
As the 39th, the squadron deployed to the European Theater in December, 1944 with 45 officers and 297 enlisted men.
The 39th flew both P-38s and P-51s during operational missions from January, 1945 to the end of the war in May.
The 39th returned to the states in August, 1945 and was re designated as the 101st Fighter Squadron in May, 1946 and inactivated two month later.
During the summer of 1946, 101st veterans and Army Air Force veterans reorganized the 101st at Logan Airport.
The squadron was equipped with the P-47 Thunderbolt and was Federally recognized on 15 Oct. 1946.


After the end of the war, the 101st moved to Logan International Airport.
The 102nd Fighter Group was formed in 1946 and assigned to the Massachusetts Air National Guard.
The 101st immediately fell under the command of the 102nd.
In 1950, the 102nd was recalled to active duty and assigned to the Air Defense Command.
Remaining at home station, the wing stood on runway alert throughout the Korean conflict.
From 1956 to 1976, the 102nd was headed by Brigadier General Charles W. Sweeney, who piloted the B-29 Superfortress, which dropped the Fat Man atomic bomb on Nagasaki, Japan in 1945.


During the summer of 1961, as the Berlin Crisis unfolded, several USAF reserve units were notified on 16 August of their pending activation and recall to active duty.
On October 1st, the Massachusetts Air National Guard's 102nd Tactical Fighter Wing and the 101st Tactical Fighter Squadron along with the 131st Tactical Fighter Squadron, and 138th Tactical Fighter Squadron went on active duty at Otis Air Force Base.

Between the 28th and 30th of October, the 102nd TFW departed Logan International Airport to Phalsbourg.
By November 1, 26 of the wing’s F-86H Sabre aircraft were on the ramp at Phalsbourg-Bourscheid Air Base, France.
The wing deployed 82 F-86H Sabres.
The 101st's planes were marked with green stripes on their vertical stabilizers.

The 102nd's primary mission at the time was to provide close air support to NATO ground forces and air interdiction.
This involved keeping its aircraft on 24/7 alert.
Starting on December 5th, the 101st began deploying to Wheelus Air Base, Libya for gunnery training.

During its time in Europe, the 101st participated in several USAF and NATO exercises, including a deployment to Leck Air Base, West Germany near the Danish border.
At Leck, ground and support crews from both countries exchanged duties, learning how to perform aircraft maintenance and operational support tasks.

On May 7 1962, the Seventeenth Air Force stated that the 102nd TFW would deploy back to CONUS during the summer, and the 102nd TFW returned to the United States in July 1962, Regular USAF personnel, along with a group of ANG personnel who volunteered to remain on active duty formed the 480th Tactical Fighter Squadron of the newly activated 366th Tactical Fighter Wing.


In 1968, the 102nd Tactical Fighter Wing moved to Otis Air Force Base.
The move to Otis for the 102nd was fitting.
The 101st Observation Squadron, forerunner of the 102nd Fighter Interceptor Wing, was the original occupant of the Otis Field and was instrumental in its construction on the Camp Edwards property.
The original intent of Otis Field was for utilization by National Guard aircraft.
The squadron flew the F-84F Thunderstreak until June 1971, when a squadron of F-100D Super Sabres was transferred directly from units fighting the Vietnam War.
After making the transition to the "Hun," a shift in United States Department of Defense military planning brought still more change to the 101st and its' mission.
The Mach 2 F-106 Delta Darts soon arrived on the 101st's parking ramp.
On June 10 1972, the unit officially became the 101st Air Defense Squadron.
Upon completion of transition, the squadron commenced an air defense alert commitment on a 24-hour, 365-days-a-year basis.
The squadron participated in the interception of Soviet TU-95 Bear bombers on many occasions, the first of which occurred off Long Island in 1975.
Many of these occasions included escorting the aircraft to Cuba.
Other escort missions involved the escorting of drug smuggling planes and the identifying of one mysterious ghost plane, which turned out later to be a weather balloon..
In 1972, the 101st Fighter Interceptor Squadron, was placed on an air defense alert mission.
This mission was continued right up to January 24 2008.
It was also the first Air National Guard unit to received the F-15 Eagle.


The squadron continued air defense mission after the fall of the Soviet Union.
Examples of this include a 1992 deployment of eight pilots, five F-15 Eagles, and 48 maintenance and security personnel, for five days to Canadian Forces Base Goose Bay, Labrador, Canada.
Another is the humanitarian deployment of 50 personnel from the 102nd Civil Engineering Squadron under field conditions, to the island of Eleuthera in the Bahamas in July 1993.
They helped to rebuild school buildings and municipal facilities that were damaged by Hurricane Andrew.
During the years of 1991 through 1995 the wing deployed to Panama as part of Operation Coronet Nighthawk, a drug interdiction operation.
From 1995-1998 the squadron deployed to Iceland for 45 days of air defense duty.
During 1998 members both trained for and performed in real-world contingency assignments in Iceland, Canada, Korea, and Europe.
In 1999 the squadron also participated in Operation Northern Watch when it deployed with its F-15 Eagle aircraft to Turkey to patrol and enforce the no-fly zone north of the 36th Parallel in northern Iraq.
The squadron again deployed more than 350 personnel to the Middle East and Europe in 2000 to participate in Operation Southern Watch.


On September 11, 2001, the squadron sprang into action just minutes after the terrorists attacks on the World Trade Center in New York City.
More than 600 wing members were mobilized for Operation Noble Eagle.
The wing began flying around-the-clock combat air patrols missions immediately thereafter, and continued doing so until February 2002.
Overall during 2001, squadron aircraft flew 2,388 sorties compiling more than 3750 flying hours.
Furthermore, the squadron escorted the plane that carried shoe bomber Richard Reid.


The BRAC 2005 commission originally planned to close the base and dissolve the fighter wing and squadron.
Locals argued that this would leave a huge gap in the national air defenses and they were right.
They also argued that the fighter jets had also been the first to scramble during 9/11.
BRAC officials, after visiting the base, decided to keep it open and keep the wing but the 102nd would still lose its planes, only this time they were only going to the 104th Fighter Wing, based at Barnes Municipal Airport.
Some people were willing to see the base closed but many in the community have gotten so used to the sound of the jets that they really did not want to see them go.

The 102nd hosted its last airshow with the F-15 during the tail end of Air Force Week.
The wing also shared the last months with its aircraft with the 101st Air Refueling Wing, and the 103rd Fighter Wing, and the 104th Fighter Wing.
The three wings lost and gained new aircraft with the decisions that BRAC made.
Beginning in 2007, planes started transitioning to Barnes Municipal Airport.
With the grounding of the F-15 Eagles, the 158th Fighter Wing, which is based in Vermont temporarily took over the role of patrolling the Northeast's skies.
This interruption of the flying of the planes, coinciding with the transitioning of the fighter jets to the 104th Fighter Wing, created some issues.
The move was scheduled to be completed at the end of January, but the grounding of the F-15's in 2007 and early 2008 delayed this move to the end of February.


On January 24 2008, the 101st Intelligence Squadron officially flew its last patrol mission.
After 35 years of being on constant alert status, the squadron was officially ordered to stand down.
The unit's wing commander, Colonel Anthony Schiavi, led the flight, accompanied by Major Daniel Nash, who was one of the first responders for 9/11.
Fire trucks were on hand when the team landed a half-hour later, giving the planes and the pilots the customary ceremonial hose-down for the last time.
The wing was responsible for airspace spanning the area from the Canadian border to Washington D.C., about  of area.
The 87 years of the 101st Fighter Squadron's flying mission came to an end on that day.
Those years are now a memory as the squadron is now without a flying mission.


As soon as it was announced that the squadron would be kept alive and Otis Air National Guard Base would remain open, people began thinking of the future for the 101st and 102nd.
There was talk that the wing could transition to an intelligence mission so that it could help support the growing War On Terror.
The plans hit a roadblock when it was announced that there were few funds left with which the squadron could use to transition into its new mission.
The new mission was finally confirmed when Governor Deval Patrick announced that the wing would transition to an intelligence mission as soon as the planes left.
Original BRAC plans only said that a Distributed Common Ground Station would be created at Otis.
This didn't include the air guardsmen affected by the loss of their jobs.
The issue was finally resolved when the Air Force announced its plans, right before the F-15's started to leave for Barnes.
Some guardsmen and women have decided to stay with the 102nd so that they would not have to uproot their lives and move to the other side of the state.
Others have decided to follow the F-15's to Barnes and continue on with their flying careers.
Those that have stayed are currently being retrained so that they can have an important part in the future of our nation.
There are currently no known plans on the table, which would include the wing flying again.
On April 1 2008, the 101st Fighter Squadron was re designated as the 101st Intelligence Squadron.
The formal ceremony to celebrate this change was held on April 6th.
The buildings that are being converted will start being ready soon and the squadron will reach full operation in 2010.
By October 1st, 2008, the squadron is expected to be operationally ready.

Six regiments of the British Army have been numbered the 101st Regiment of Foot:

101st Regiment of Foot, or Johnstone's Highlanders, raised in 1760
101st Regiment of Foot, raised in 1780
101st Regiment of Foot, raised in 1794
101st Regiment of Foot (Duke of York's Irish), raised in 1805
101st Regiment of Foot (Royal Bengal Fusiliers), raised by the East India Company and placed on the British establishment as the 101st Foot in 1862


The 101st Regiment of Foot, or Johnston's Highlanders, was an infantry regiment of the British Army, formed in 1760 and disbanded in 1763.

The regiment was raised in 1760 by the regimentation of independent companies of infantry raised in Argyle and Rossshire; in 1761 it was moved into England, and its other ranks drafted to the 87th and 88th Foot.
The officers were returned to Perth to assemble another six companies in 1762, but after these were assembled the regiment was disbanded due to the end of hostilities.

The unofficial title Johnston's Highlanders was adopted from its first Major-Commandant, Sir James Johnston of Westerhall.


The 101st Regiment of Foot (Royal Bengal Fusiliers) was a regiment of the British Army from 1862 to 1881 but with a lineage going back to 1652.


The regiment was formed as part of the Honourable East India Company's army firstly as a Guard of Honour in 1652.
By 1756 it was the Bengal European Regiment - 'European' indicating it was composed of white soldiers, not Indian sepoys - and when this was split in 1765, it became the 1st Bengal European Regiment.

In 1846 it was the 1st Bengal (European) Fusiliers retaining this title when the regiment was transferred to the Crown after the 1857 Indian Mutiny.
The "European" was dropped and then it was given Royal in its title to become 1st Royal Bengal Fusiliers in 1861.
The regiment was then transferred to the British Army and renumbered as the 101st Regiment of Foot at the same time retaining the Royal Bengal name.

In 1881 it was combined with the 104th Regiment of Foot (Bengal Fusiliers) to form part of the new Royal Munster Fusiliers.


The 101st Rescue Squadron (101 RQS) is a combat rescue unit of the New York Air National Guard.
Its parent unit is the 106th Rescue Wing.


Federal: To organize, train and operate in a combat environment providing aerial rescue services and to maintain a state of readiness and execute assigned rescue missions of downed airmen.

State: To assist the state of New York in disaster relief and other state emergencies as directed by the Governor.


The 101st Rescue Squadron was activated in 2004 in a reorganization of combat rescue wings within the United States Air Force.
The creation of the 101 RQS allowed combat rescue assets to have separate squadrons flying one type of aircraft.
The 101 RQS flies the HH-60 Pave Hawk.

With D-Day landings on June 6 it was ordered to Normandy where it arrived despite heavy aerial bombardment on June 12.
After weeks of heavy fighting, most famously at the Battle of Villers-Bocage, by July 5 the battalion lost 15 of its 45 Tigers.

At this time units surplus crews were pulled back from the front and started being outfitted with the new Tiger II tanks.
By August 7 the remainder of the division left in Normandy counted 25 Tigers of which 21 were still operational.
The battalion lost virtually all its remaining Tigers during the heavy fighting at the Falaise pocket and subsequent massive German retreat from France.

On September 9, the remains of the unit were ordered to rest and completely refit with the new Tiger II's, with this change on September 22, 1944, it was redesignated Schwere SS-Panzer-Abteilung 501.

101st kilometre is a colloquial name for the law restricting freedom of movement in the Soviet Union.

In the Soviet Union, the rights of an inmate released from the prison would typically still be restricted for a long period of time.
Instead of regular documents, inmates would receive a temporary substitute, a "wolf ticket" (), confining them to internal exile without the right to settle closer than 100 km (62 miles) from large urban centers.
This has resulted in many residential communities established at 101 km (63 mi) away from city borders.
In modern Russia, the restrictions have been abolished and the expression is used in a context is similar to that of boondocks.

102 Dalmatians is a 2000 live-action film, produced by The Walt Disney Company and starring Glenn Close as the villainous Cruella de Vil.
It is a sequel to the 1996 film Disney's 101 Dalmatians, itself a live-action remake of the 1961 Disney animated feature of the same name.
In the film, Cruella de Vil attempts to steal puppies for her "grandest" fur coat yet.
Glenn Close and Tim McInnerny were the only actors from the first film to return for this sequel.
This movie was released on VHS & DVD on April 3, 2001.
Disney is going to re-release this movie on DVD and Blu-ray Disc on September 16, 2008.


Cruella de Vil, after three years in prison, has been cured by Dr. Pavlov to make sure she never has a lust for fur coats.
She is subsequently released on parole, but on the understanding that, should she repeat her crimes, her money will be donated to a dogs' home and she will be sent back to prison.
As a result of the curing, Cruella, now called 'Ella', begins to have love for animals and as she is released, she rids herself of her old fur coats and the drawing of her in a Dalmatian puppy coat.

Meanwhile, Dipstick, one of the puppies from the first film (one of the original 15 puppies of Pongo and Perdita), is now an adult and is owned by Cruella's probation officer, Chloe Simon, who purchased Dipstick from Roger and Anita Dearly.
Dipstick is the mate to Chloe's female Dalmatian, Dottie, and the couple has three puppies by the names of Domino- due to the domino-like spots on his ears-, Little Dipper- with a black tail like his father- and Oddball, whom the parents are protective of and is often "an odd one", mainly due to her lack of spots.
The pups, now a few weeks old, are watching their father and Chloe's friend, Agnes, playing a boxing game.
While Cruella has a conversation with Chloe, Oddball is becoming obsessed with spots since she is the only member in her family who doesn't have spots.
While she uses ink to pretend she has spots, Oddball is knocked out of a window and her brothers follow her.

Soon, Chloe and Agnes rush to rescue them and as the sounds of Big Ben, the city's clock tower, begin to dong, Cruella begins to feel urges, recognising Dipstick from her prior experience.
After the scuffle, she begins to see spots everywhere in the city since sounds of the clock tower have jolted her brain waves back into her old self.

Cruella then plans to get the ultimate fur coat: the Dalmatian puppy coat.
As her servant Alonzo heads off to find a few puppies, Cruella hires furrier Jean-Pierre LePelt to help her on her way to capture 102 puppies (She's modified the original coat to include a hood, hence the extra three puppies).
Kevin Shepard, the owner of the Second Chance dog shelter where Cruella has been serving her community service- and, ironically the dogs' home that would receive Cruella's money if she repeated her crimes-, asks Chloe to come to dinner while Dipstick, Dottie, the pups and Kevin's adopted dogs (as well as a parrot named Waddlesworth who's convinced he's a rotteweiler) watch a children's movie (Disney's Lady and the Tramp).
Soon, Alonzo gathers more puppies and as a call announced that a box of abandoned puppies are at the bridge.
Kevin gets his friend, Ewan, to find them, but as the police arrive at the shelter, they think that Kevin had stolen the puppies with the intention of framing Cruella.

Arrested, Kevin and his dogs begin to have a bad life at prison and as Cruella invites Chloe to dinner, Jean-Pierre sneaks into her apartment to capture Domino, Little Dipper, and Oddball.
However, he ends up being ambushed by Dottie, who bites Jean-Pierre twice in the butt.
After capturing her, he gets the pups and after the furrier trips into the closet.
Oddball, after making an alert, then is finally caught by Jean-Pierre and Dipstick follows them on the way.
Hearing the alert, Kevin and the dogs escaped out the prison and as they hear that Cruella, Jean-Pierre, and Alonzo are heading to Paris.

Oddball is left behind after Cruella realises her spotless state, but Waddlesworth flies to her when she attempts to follow her brothers onto the train, realizing that he's not a rotweiler after all, he's a retriever!
Sneaking into a fur factory, Waddlesworth and Oddball discover the other puppies in the basement and managed to get them out after Chloe and Kevin are trapped by Cruella along with the dogs.
As they head to the bakery, Cruella, furious, heads after them while Alonzo and Jean-Pierre have a fight.
After trapping him, the humans and dogs head off to find the puppies.

At the bakery, Cruella attempts to get Oddball after being put in cake machinery, having eggs all over her, getting dumped by flour, and getting stuck inside the cake batter.
Covered in the batter, she throws Oddball in the way of three shredders but she manages to avoid getting killed and Cruella is forced into the oven.
As the family reunites, Cruella, inside a cake, gets squirted by frosting, has sprinkles dumped on her, and gets drooled.
Then she is kicked into the restaurant and she and Jean-Pierre are later put into prison.

A few weeks later in London, Kevin and Chloe are now engaged and Second Chance receives, as per the court order, Cruella's fortune amounting to £8 million; Alonzo personally delivers the check.
Chloe and Kevin share a kiss while Oddball appears at the shelter's sign, slides and jumps onto Chloe, covered in dirty spots.
At the very end of the film, it turns out that Oddball finally has her spots and everyone became excited to see that the protagonist has her inheritance at last.


The film did well at the box office, earning $66,957,026 in the US and $116,654,745 overseas, bringing it's total to $183,611,771 worldwide.
However, this is considerably less than the first film which earned $320,689,294 worldwide.


102 Dalmatians: Puppies to the Rescue is a videogame based on the live-action Disney movie 102 Dalmatians.
It made its debut on the Sony PlayStation.

The game itself follows the films' storyline closely.
The player can choose the role of two of the dalmatians, Oddball or Domino, who are out on the town looking for treasure.
It's not long before the player realizes that a toy found buried in a park was made at one of Cruella de Vil's toy factories; the fact that her toys are being buried rather than being played with is making mean Cruella very upset.
Facing financial ruin from lack of sales, Cruella sets an evil plan in motion - to reprogram her toys to capture any Dalmatian puppies in sight.
Soon enough, Domino and Oddball are out on their biggest adventure yet - to save their brothers and sisters.
The player needs to save their brothers and sisters, collect 100 bones and stop Cruella's henchmen.
Player's health can be increased up by picking up food.
The player fights Cruella a few times, then off to the Toy Factory where Cruella is waiting for them.


102 JAMZ' SuperJam is an annual summer concert starring some of the hottest artists in hip hop that is hosted by Urban Contemporary radio station WJMH (102 JAMZ)/Greensboro, North Carolina.
The show has been held at the 20,000+ seat Greensboro Coliseum every year.

Ever since it launched the event in 1997, 102 JAMZ has presented SuperJam, which attracts thousands of listeners from North Carolina and southern Virginia, with numerous annual attendees traveling from locations throughout the United States.
As of 2008, all 12 SuperJam concerts have been sellout events.


The station's debut summer show, SuperJam, took place Friday night, June 20 1997, at Greensboro Coliseum in front of 20,000 fans and featured Bone Thugs-n-Harmony, Junior M.A.F.I.A., Lil' Kim, OutKast, Lost Boyz, SWV, Freak Nasty and others.
Successive annual SuperJams have included artists such as Jay-Z, Ludacris, Diddy, T.I., Bow Wow, Lil Jon & the East Side Boyz, Fat Joe, Ja Rule, Three 6 Mafia, N.O.R.E., Young Jeezy, LL Cool J, Ying Yang Twins, Nas, Busta Rhymes, T-Pain, Big Pun, Cam'Ron, Slick Rick and Doug E. Fresh, Yung Joc, Dru Hill, Dem Franchize Boyz, Jermaine Dupree, Trina, Redman, Petey Pablo, 112, Trillville, Elephant Man, Trick Daddy, DJ Kool, Chingy, Jagged Edge, Da Brat, Plies, The Dream, Ray-J, Shawty Lo, Crime Mob, Young Joc, Lil Wayne, Sheek Louch, Lloyd, Dolla and many, many more.


All SuperJam concerts have taken place on Friday nights in late June and have been held at Greensboro Coliseum.
Showtime has remained 7:30 PM, throughout.
The entire 102 JAMZ airstaff, the 102 JAMZ Mix Squad and the JAMZ Street Team have actively participated in each event, hosting during the time between acts and emceeing during Mix Squad intervals.
Since SuperJam VII, the 102 JAMZ Dancers, led by Lady C of Sunday night's 11:00 Reggae Jamz show, have performed a choreographed routine between acts during each SuperJam.

Most 102 JAMZ SuperJam concerts have been numbered consecutively, with the exception of the 1st (simply called SuperJam), the 4th (SuperJam 2000) and the 11th (again referred to officially as SuperJam, but sometimes identified internally as SuperJam 2007 or SuperJam XI).

SuperJam ticket prices have consistently remained significantly lower than other music concerts, from the beginning.
The 2007 performance featured tickets at $10, $15, and $25, with a few VIP floor seats at $28.50.
As Program Director, Brian Douglas, explains, "SuperJam is one of the best ways we're able to give back and say thanks to our listeners every year.
With concert tickets at $50 or more for good shows, SuperJam has always been about offering more acts for less money.
We want every listener to be able to afford a ticket... then, we want every show to be one they'll remember."


Since 1999, each SuperJam concert has been preceded by a 102 JAMZ Block Party, hosted by the station's afternoon personality (originally Boogie D, now Big Tap Money).
These "party before the party" events, originally held outside the coliseum and more recently in the Greensboro Coliseum Pavilion, feature hundreds of ticket upgrades, impromptu performances by the night's talent lineup and live, interactive artist interviews.
SuperJam Block Parties are carried live on 102 JAMZ, from 3:00 to 7:00 PM, to set the stage for the show and get the listeners ready for the concert.


According to the programming staff, planning for each year's SuperJam begins in "Jam-Uary" (January).
Brian Douglas states that inspiration for the creation of the SuperJam concept arose from two sources... exposure to annual summer concerts put together by a radio station in his native Florida during his youth (WAPE, Jacksonville's Big Ape Conventions and Big Ape Shower of Stars) and 102 JAMZ' experiment with a modified summer concert in 1996.
This outdoor event, billed as Busta Brown Bingo, was presented as part of a contest in which featured afternoon personality Busta Brown skydived onto a random block in a squared-off area to award a station contestant $10,000.
As incentive for others to attend, the station assembled acts to perform, including Junior M.A.F.I.A. with Lil' Kim, 112, Bahamadia and Nonchalant.
Attendance was strong and listeners responded positively to the concept, setting the stage for the original SuperJam, one year later.


The 11th annual SuperJam concert took place Friday night, June 29 2007 and featured Young Jeezy, Yung Joc, Crime Mob, Lloyd, DJ Unk, M.I.M.S., Rich Boy, and Omarion.
On stage activity was non-stop, with air personality/audience interaction, Mix Squad sets, the 102 JAMZ Dancers, plus giveaways of a set of rims, cash and SuperJam shirts bridging the short gaps between the acts.


Tickets for the 12th annual SuperJam went on sale Friday, May 16th.
The concert is Friday, June 27th at 7:30pm.
On Friday, May 31st, Plies came to 102 JAMZ to announce that he would be performing at SuperJam.
He also announced The Dream and Dolla as confirmed acts and promised more to come.
On Monday, June 2nd, 102 JAMZ started saying that they would announce more acts that Friday (June 6th) and would send an email out to its Hard Hittaz (102JAMZ.com members) before then.
On Thursday, June 5th at around 4:30, Hard Hittaz received the email announcing Shawty Lo, Ray J and 2 Pistols as three more confirmed acts.
Once again, 102 JAMZ announced they would be making an announcement for more confirmed acts on Friday (June 13th) and would send the email out early.
Around 5:15pm on Thursday (June 12th), Hard Hittaz received the email announcing Flo Rida and Sheek Louch as confirmed acts.
The email stated, "Plies, The-Dream, Shawty Lo, Ray J, 2 Pistols, Dolla and now Sheek Louch and Flo Rida...
SuperJam 2008, y'all!" implying that is the final confirmed lineup.
It was announced prior to the show the Dolla would not be making it.
Live at SuperJam, 102 JAMZ DJ Waleed Coyote announced there was a surprise guest, Three Six Mafia.

102.2 Jazz FM (also known as London Jazz Radio and JFM) was a local jazz and soul music station for London run by GMG Radio.
The station was based at Castlereagh Street in London.

As well as broadcasting on FM in London, Jazz FM was also made available on digital radio in the United Kingdom via the Sky Digital platform on April 30 2002 and on the Freeview platform on October 30, 2002.
Both launches were preceded by test transmissions.
Jazz FM was also available on DAB digital radio on a number of MXR multiplexes across England, South Wales and Central Scotland (excluding MXR North West, which hosted the defunct 100.4 Jazz FM service for the North West) and the Switch Digital multiplex covering Greater London.
Jazz FM was also broadcast around the world on the Internet through their website.

After disappointing RAJAR figures, GMG Radio rebranded the station as 102.2 Smooth FM in June 2005.

On February 28 2008 GMG Radio announced the potential return of Jazz FM in London on DAB radio.


The station still broadcasts under the Jazz FM name on the Internet and on DAB in West Central Scotland.
The DAB service carries the Blue Room feed from jazzfm.com at a higher bitrate.


When Jazz FM launched, the station played a mixture of mainstream jazz, with the daytime schedules originally dedicated to smooth jazz, and some soul programming.
Specialist programming from Jez Nelson and live concerts were broadcast in the evening and at weekends.
In 1992, the policy changed and all non-jazz programming was taken off the schedules.

To counteract a downturn in listeners to Jazz FM, from 1998, smooth jazz and soul music was more integrated into the core playlist of Jazz FM.

Although Jazz FM has originally from the start played jazz music, more soul and softer R&B music was added later on in Jazz FM's lifetime to appeal to the 25-45 year old market that Jazz FM needed to entice to the station, especially after GMG Radio took over the running of the station.


The station was launched as a result of a ten year campaign by musician Dave Lee, who was inspired after listening to a Los Angeles jazz radio station, which has since turned into a classical station.
The licence to broadcast was given in 1990 to London Jazz Radio who subsequently changed their name to Jazz FM on launch.
Jazz FM launched on the 4 March 1990 with an Ella Fitzgerald concert at the Royal Festival Hall in London.

In 1992, Jazz FM was bought by Golden Rose Communications.

In 1994, the name of the station was changed to JFM by the station's management in order to appeal to more listeners who may have been put off by the name "jazz" in Jazz FM.
After 15 months in the autumn of 1995 however, the name reverted to Jazz FM.

On December 12 1999, Golden Rose Communications changed its name to Jazz FM plc.

In January 2002, Jazz FM plc made a £20 million bid for London talk radio station London News Radio.
The station was later sold to the Chrysalis Group.

In 2002, US radio audience research company Arbitron announced that Jazz FM was the most listened to Internet radio station.

Jazz FM was purchased by the Guardian Media Group in July 2002 for £41 million from Jazz FM plc.
In December 2002, GMG moved its sales operation from Clear Channel Radio Sales to the Chrysalis Group, inline with the sales operation for other GMG Radio stations.


On February 28 2008 GMG Radio's chief executive John Myers made an announcement that Jazz FM would be brought back in London, the North West and the West Midlands on DAB.
Myers also said that he believed it would make more sense for there to be a dedicated radio station for jazz listeners than the current 45 hours of jazz to be played on Smooth FM, as required by the licence granted to them by Ofcom.
The closure of theJazz on Digital One was also part of the reason for the return of Jazz FM.
The relaunch will happen later in 2008.


Plans for a Jazz FM TV channel to launch in the middle of 2004 were reported by various websites, but the idea has been subsequently canned.


Kay Garner, a British jazz singer, was asked by the founder of Jazz FM, Dave Lee, to sing the original jingles for the station when it launched in 1990.
Jazz FM has also had many other jingles and slogans during its 15 year life, including "Listen in Colour" (featuring the Jazz FM chameleon) produced by the Willox Ambler Rodford Law advertising agency , "The Rhythm Of The City" and afterwards, during the GMG era, "Get It On", which was swiftly replaced on-air by "Smooth Jazz and Classic Soul".
The Bespoke Music Company created the Jazz FM jingles which were in use since the 1st of January 2003, until 102.2 Jazz FM was relaunched as 102.2 Smooth FM.
A sample of the jingles used can be heard from their website.


Ever since the station launched in 1990, many fans of traditional and modern jazz had criticised Jazz FM for pandering to more 'accessible' music, with Jazz FM playing more soul and R&B music, especially during the daytime schedules.
In March 2003 the Radio Authority (since embodied into the UK governments communications regulator, Ofcom) investigated Jazz FM after it received two complaints from listeners who complained that the station was playing more "pop" music, after changes made to the Jazz FM playlist in January 2003.

Professional British jazz musician and former Jazz FM presenter, Digby Fairweather in 2006 wrote an article on the, at the time, upcoming British jazz radio station, theJazz.
In the article, he said that Jazz FM had turned into a "tragic and swift disaster story" and that the change of playlist later on was "responsible for both the attempted rape and (fortunately abortive) re-definition of the music" to which no-one within the Jazz FM coverage area would forgive.

Ofcom as part of its licence agreement with Jazz FM, stated that Jazz FM had to dedicate at least 50% of the daytime output to 'Jazz' music.
However, from the 15 November 2003, as part of an agreement with the Guardian Media Group, Ofcom agreed to allow GMG to change the format of the station.
John Myers, the chief executive of GMG said "The policy we are going on is ratings by day, reputation by night.
Jazz is much more of a night-time listen so the changes fit well."
As a result, jazz music was increased from 40 hours to 45 hours and the Dinner Jazz programme hours were increased from two to three.

In 2005, GMG made the decision to drop the jazz name completely and rebrand Jazz FM to Smooth FM.
GMG stated that this was due to disappointing RAJAR figures and that Jazz FM did not make a profit during the 15 years it broadcast.
However, in 2001 Jazz FM plc did make a profit before tax of £60,000, with most of the profit coming from Hed Kandi and other Jazz FM Records CD sales, , a move of Jazz FM's sales team to Clear Channel's control, saving Jazz FM plc £1 million pounds every year and increased revenues from advertising due to higher audience figures.

Chief Executive of GMG John Myers said: "As sorry as we are to say goodbye to Jazz FM, it’s a sad fact of life that it has never made a profit in its 15 years of existence."
Another reason given for the rebranding was that the Jazz FM name was putting people off listening to the station, as well as the station not playing enough jazz for the purists.
The latter situation was solved by GMG Radio by adding additional investment into the ejazz.fm website and changing the name to jazzfm.com at the same time 102.2 Jazz FM became 102.2 Smooth FM.
Included in the investment would be two dedicated jazz stations that still run to this day.

The North West version of Jazz FM was the first to rebrand on the 1 March 2004 and then the London version (including the Freeview and many of the DAB feeds) on the 7 June 2005.
During the last few weeks before the launch of Smooth FM, Jazz FM changed its jingles slightly from "Smooth Jazz and Classic Soul" to "London's Smooth Favourites" as an indication to listeners of the change to come.

Jazz FM in its previous form closed on Friday the 27 May 2005 with the last track played being, rather fittingly, Ella Fitzgerald's 'Ev'ry Time We Say Goodbye'.
GMG then played a promotion for Smooth FM alongside music tracks to be played on the new station and live news at the top of the hour until the launch of Smooth FM at 10am on the 7 June with the help of R&B singer Lemar and then breakfast show presenter Jon Scragg.


Jazz FM, like its counterpart GMG radio stations, held 'Bring A Pound To Work Day' in late October/early November 2003/2004.
Listeners were asked to donate and collect pound coins for a local children's charity - Nordoff Robbins in 2003 and the Lennox Children's Cancer Fund the following year.
Listeners could also text message a number for donations at a cost of £1.50, of which £1 went to the charity.
Jazz FM has also held auctions in past years to help boost the money raised for charity.
Lots included a signed edition of Harry Potter, exclusive concert tickets and even a chance to join the former breakfast presenter Jon Scragg on his show for one day.
'Bring A Pound To Work Day' was enormously successful for the chosen charities; in 2004, enough was raised to purchase a new Lennox holiday home on the south coast of England.

The automated Jazz FM service that exists today no longer runs 'Bring A Pound To Work Day', although the campaign remains on other GMG stations.
Jazz FM's successor Smooth FM have rebranded their fundraising effort the Smooth Appeal.


Many of the programmes that formerly played on Jazz FM did continue to be broadcast for a while on Smooth FM and were are made available for download on the jazzfm.com website until 2008.
Andy Peebles' Soul and Soccer: A three hour show on Saturday afternoons featuring soul music alongside soccer updates and scores.
The show continues on 100.4 Smooth FM but is now entirely playlisted, and musically mirrors the station's normal music output.
Behind The Mask: A six-part series which was commissioned in early 2003 following GMG's purchase of the station which saw vocalist Alison Moyet profiling well-known figures within the jazz industry.
Behind The Mic: An occasional series which tended to air on Saturday lunchtimes between 1pm and 2pm - famous figures within the jazz/soul industry were invited to play their favourite songs.
Dinner Jazz: One of Jazz FM's flagship shows on weekdays between 7pm and 9pm/10pm featuring easy listening and jazz.
Drivetime with Russell Pockett: A four hour show playing jazz and soul music, included the Million Sellers at 3pm, which only played songs that sold a million records or over and the Top 3 Most Requested at 5pm, where a listener requests three pieces of music to be played in sequence on the show.
Hed Kandi: Hed Kandi was comprised of two parts, between 2am and 5am, presenters Mark Doyle and Andy Norman played dance music for the "post-clubbing generation".
Then, for one hour between 5am and 6am, the Hed Kandi Chillout Hour played more chilled out music.
Legends of Jazz with Ramsey Lewis: A show which features classic jazz recordings from major and influential jazz artists.
Mainstem with Campbell Burnap: A two hour programme which included many forms of jazz from classic to Latin as well as a mix of jazz from the younger players of the day.
Mike Chadwick's Cutting Edge: A two hour show on Saturday nights featuring contemporary jazz music.
The Cutting Edge is still being produced and the show can be listened to on the jazzfm.com website.
Paul Gambaccini's Jazz 20: A jazz chart show which was originally broadcast on Saturdays but which moved to Sundays in 2004, and became the 'Jazz 40', between 5pm and 8pm.
Peter Young's The Soul Cellar: A show on Sunday afternoons which featured soul music, including northern soul.
Smooth Jazz Through The Night: A three hour show through the night which played well known smooth jazz records from the archives of Jazz FM.
Somethin' Else: A four hour show on week nights featuring contemporary and classic jazz music, competitions and listener contributions.
Presented and produced by Jez Nelson and Chris Phillips.
The Late Lounge with Rosie Kendrick: A two hour show featuring chillout grooves and jazz.
Tony Blackburn's Real Party Night: A show presented by Tony Blackburn featuring lively soul and disco music from the ages.
Tony Blackburn also presented a show on Jazz FM called Real Soul between 10pm and 12am on weeknights from March 2003 for twelve months.
Real Soul was replaced by a three hour show from March 1, 2004 featuring jazz, soul and R&B music presented by Clive Warren.


Jazz FM also had an established record label called Jazz FM Records, publishing smooth jazz and soul music in line with its former music output before the rebrand.


Jazz FM Records also brought out compilation tracks from the Hed Kandi team before Hed Kandi Records was set up as a label in its own right.
In 2001, Jazz FM promoted their Hed Kandi record label in Ibiza, by hosting twelve weekends of dance and house music at the Pacha nightclub in Ibiza.
This followed previous events elsewhere in Ibiza, Amsterdam and London.

Jazz FM Records has since been renamed Enterprise Records, which in turn was bought by the Ministry of Sound record label from the Guardian Media Group for an undisclosed sum in January 2006.
However, under plans to relaunch jazzfm.com as Jazz FM, the Jazz FM Records label may be brought back.


Jazz FM Events specialised in setting up and providing events based on a wide range of jazz and soul music based on the radio stations output.
This included anything from concerts to performances in bars across the UK.
Major events would be publicised via the radio station and the Jazz FM website, including the famous Soul Weekender weekends.


Jazz FM Connections was a dating site run by People2People.com.
The service required an individual to pay a subscription to chat and meet up with other people registered on the service.
The service continued as Smooth FM Connections, and later became Smooth Soulmates.


102.2 Smooth FM was an Independent Local Radio station for Greater London.
It replaced 102.2 Jazz FM on the 7 June 2005 at 10am, with the help of R&B singer Lemar and the then breakfast show host Jon Scragg.
The first track played, keeping with the name of the newly launched radio station was Sade Adu's "Smooth Operator", and was owned by the radio division of the Guardian Media Group, GMG Radio.
Following disappointing audience figures, the station was closed on the 23 March 2007 and relaunched as 102.2 Smooth Radio the following Monday, following a successful format change request to Ofcom to play music orientated at listeners aged 50 and above.

102.2 Smooth FM was available on DAB across London, Central Scotland, the North East of England, South Wales and the Severn Estuary, Yorkshire and the West Midlands, as well as on Freeview channel 718.


In 2005, the Guardian Media Group made the decision to drop the jazz name from the Jazz FM brand and relaunch the station as Smooth FM.
The London version of Jazz FM closed on the 27 May 2005 to prepare for the launch of Smooth FM on the 7 June.


102.2 Smooth FM played middle of the road music, soul and R&B during the day and, as part of its licence requirements, focused on jazz music at night.
Smooth FM also played specialist jazz and soul shows at weekends, details of which are listed below.

The station was launched on the premise of a 'clutter-free' listen, offering 40 minutes of non-stop music every hour without commercial interruptions, deliberately posed as a direct challenge to the 'might' of the BBC and a tactic aimed at increasing the total number of hours listeners stayed with the station.
The 'Smooth 40' later became the '9-5 Smooth 40', with off-peak shows introducing more commercial breaks into their output, before the concept was dropped altogether in mid-2006.

Weekday programming featured an 'all-request' feature entitled 'Smooth On Demand' at 2 pm and 7 pm, Monday to Friday, where listeners were invited to 'demand' their favourite song by calling a local-rate phone number.

Smooth FM also ran a number of 'big money' promotions to entice listeners to trial the station - the 'Smooth £10K Tripleplay' ran for several weeks in late 2005, giving £10,000 to a listener for correctly identifying three consecutive songs in a particular order.
Another large prize was awarded to Dawn Muggleton on the 19 April, 2006, however - who correctly identified the 'Smooth Secret Song' (Diana Ross' My Old Piano), winning £118,454 at the end of a contest that had run for several months, which was, at that time, the biggest cash prize awarded on UK radio since 1999.

The station also held exclusive live commentary rights for Chelsea FC soccer matches in London for the 2005/06 and 2006/07 seasons.
Commentary was provided by Gary Taphouse and Kerry Dixon.

The station's jingle package was produced by Bespoke, and voiced by Mitch Johnson.


Motown Sunday: Four hours of Motown classics, initially hosted by programme director Mark Walker and later by Dave Brown.
Legends of Jazz with Ramsey Lewis: A show which featured classic jazz recordings from major and influential jazz artists.
Mainstem with Campbell Burnap: A two hour programme which included many forms of jazz from classic to Latin as well as a mix of jazz from the younger players of the day.

On 20 October, 2006, GMG Radio announced that it was requesting a change of format for Smooth FM from Ofcom, moving the station away from its daytime soul and R&B remit, instead offering easy listening music and speech for the over 50's and an improved local news service.
Ofcom approved the changes on December 8th, 2006, with the condition that GMG retained the 45 hours of jazz per week that constituted part of the former licence requirement.

Smooth FM trailed the forthcoming changes from the beginning of March 2007, promising 'more of London's smooth favourites mixed with the best songs from the past five decades'.
The station closed at 6:02pm on Friday 23 March 2007 with newsreader Sam Gudger uttering the final words - "that was Smooth FM" - followed by a weekend of preview music, before the station's replacement, 102.2 Smooth Radio, launched on Monday 26 March.


102.2 Smooth Radio is an Independent Local Radio station for the Greater London area, which replaced 102.2 Smooth FM on March 26th, 2007, launched by Gavin McCoy and Barbra Streisand's A Star Is Born.
The station competes with BBC Radio 2, aiming its music at listeners aged 50 and over, and is part of the national Smooth Radio network, which encompasses the Midlands, the North West of England and Glasgow.

As well as being carried on FM in London, 102.2 Smooth Radio is simulcast on several DAB mulitplexes, online and on digital television - Sky, Freeview and Virgin Media.


The station launched on 4 March 1990 as Jazz FM, playing mainly soul and jazz music.
It was relaunched in June 2005 as 102.2 Smooth FM, playing middle of the road music, soul and R&B during the day and, as part of its licence requirements, focused on jazz music at night.
On October 20, 2006, GMG Radio announced that it was requesting a change of format for 102.2 Smooth FM from Ofcom, moving the station away from its daytime soul and R&B remit which had, until that point, formed an integral part of the licence.
GMG proposed an easy listening music service mixed with speech for the over 50's, coupled with an improved local news service.
Ofcom approved the changes on December 8th, 2006, with the condition that GMG retained the 45 hours of jazz per week that constituted part of the former licence requirement.

As a result of the format change, GMG have agreed to adhere to a minimum of 20% of its music during daytime being over 40 years old, to distance the station from its London rivals Magic and Heart 106.2.

Paul Chantler has been appointed by GMG to be full-time programme consultant to the station from 14th January 2008 for one year.
He will be working with the existing programming team to develop the sound of the station.

In March 2008, GMG requested a format change to remove the 45 hour jazz commitment it has in place for 102.2 Smooth Radio.
Part of the plans included a relaunch of Jazz FM from the current jazzfm.com service currently broadcasting on DAB in Glasgow and online on a DAB multiplex in London.
In a meeting on April 22, 2008 Ofcom denied GMG's request to drop its jazz commitments.
GMG still plan to relaunch Jazz FM despite the decision.


102.2 Smooth Radio plays middle-of-the-road, adult contemporary music, aimed at listeners aged 50 and over.

Smooth's jingle package was produced by Bespoke Music, and voiced by Sean Bolger.


102.5 Clyde 1 is a UK radio station that broadcasts to Glasgow and West Central Scotland on FM, DAB and, to the whole UK, on Freeview.


main: Radio Clyde

Clyde 1 FM was born out of the compulsory transmission splitting enforced by the UK regulators in the 1990s, developing the FM frequency into Radio Clyde into a Top-40 format radio station.

The development of live-streaming and digital radio led to a widening of the station's potential audience through carriage on the station's website and Score Digital's DAB multiplex in Glasgow.

The station's Freeview carriage came as a consequence of the closure of stable-mate 3C by the station's then-owners, and has resulted in the station receiving UK-wide broadcast.


The station broadcasts contemporary music as well as live coverage of Glasgow's football teams and broad coverage of other sport.

The station broadcasts one syndicated programme, the weekly national sales and airplay chart Hit 40 UK, as well as a simulcast of Saturday sports coverage with Clyde 2.

Radio Mercury (later Mercury FM) is a radio station in the Surrey and Sussex area of the United Kingdom that was founded on 20 October 1984.
It broadcasts on FM 102.7 (97.5 MHz around the Horsham area).


In the 1990s the station merged with rivals County Sound Radio.
Mercury then went from playing a broad mix of music to being mainly a Top 40 station, whilst County Sound concentrated more on oldies, news programing and specialist music shows.
County Sound was later remanned "Extra AM" and then again was shortly renamed to "Mercury Extra AM" to make the connection between the two stations better known.
Further name changes took place in the following years, until the Classic Gold Network took over the AM licence of 1521 kHz.

1024 is the natural number following 1023 and preceding 1025.

1024 is a power of two:  (2 to the 10th power).

1024 is the smallest number with exactly 11 divisors (but note that there are smaller numbers with more than 11 divisors; e.g., 60 has 12 divisors — see the sequence A005179 in OEIS).


The neat coincidence that 2 is nearly equal to 10 provides the basis of a technique of estimating larger powers of 2 in decimal notation.
Using 2 ≈ 210 is fairly accurate for exponents up to about 100.
For exponents up to 300, 3a continues to be a good estimate of the number of digits.

For example, 2 ≈ 8x10.
The actual value is closer to 9x10.

In the case of larger exponents the relationship becomes increasingly more inaccurate with errors exceeding an order of magnitude for , for example:

In measuring bytes 1024 is often used in place of 1000 as the quotients of the units byte, kilobyte, megabyte, etc.
In 1999, the IEC coined the term kibibyte for multiples of 1024, with kilobyte being used for multiples of 1000.
As of 2008, this convention has not been widely adopted.


In binary notation, 1024 is represented as 10000000000, making it a simple round number occurring frequently in computer applications.

1024 is the maximum number of computer memory addresses that can be referenced with ten binary switches.
This is the origin of the organization of computer memory into 1024-byte chunks (Steve Brown Method).

In the Rich Text Format, language code 1024 indicates the text is not in any language and should be skipped over when proofing.
