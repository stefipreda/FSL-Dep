The 102d Rescue Squadron is a unit of the New York Air National Guard and the oldest Air National Guard unit in the country.
It has flown a number of aircraft including balloons, biplanes, and helicopters, though it currently flies the HH-60G Pavehawk and HC-130 Hercules for its missions.
Its parent unit is the 106th Rescue Wing.


The 102d traces lineage back to the 1st Aero Squadron, which was originally formed in 1908.
In 1915, with the First World War going on in Europe, the 1st Aero Squadron was officially organized by the military as an unnumbered detachment of the 1st Battalion Signal Corps, training at Mineola, Long Island.

After World War I, the unit was renamed and officially numbered the 102nd Observational Squadron and assigned to the New York Guard.


The 102hp Walker railmotor were a diesel railcar operated by the Victorian Railways in Australia.

After the Second World War, the Victorian Railways undertook a major rebuilding program known as "Operation Phoenix".
One of the first tasks was the upgrading of passenger services on country branch lines, through the replacement of 23 wooden bodied railmotors built in the 1920s, and the withdrawal of steam locomotive hauled mixed trains.
An initial order of six 153hp railcars, twelve 102hp railcars and twelve 280hp railcars from Walker Brothers in Wigan, England was placed, this was extended to include a further 102hp railmotor, being the delivered into revenue service on Wednesday, 26 January 1955.

Thirteen 102hp units were built in total.

The power units and controls were shipped out from England and the car bodies built locally by Martin & King in Malvern, with the finished units assembled at Newport Workshops.


In military terms, 102nd Division or 102nd Infantry Division may refer to:

102nd Fortress Division (France)
102nd Infantry Division (Germany)
102nd Infantry Division (United States)


The French 102nd Fortress Division was a French Army formation during World War II.

During the Battle of France in May 1940, the division was made up of the following units:

148 Fortress Infantry Regiment
42 Colonial Machine Half Brigade
52 Colonial Machine Gun Half Brigade
3 Machine Gun Battalion
160 Artillery Regiment
218 Artillery Regiment

It was a Series A reserve division which contained younger reservists.
It was a Fortress Division defending the French Border with Belgium.


The 102nd Infantry Division was a German military unit during World War II.


The division was formed on 15 December 1940 in Wehrkreis II (Mecklenburg/Pomerania), in the 12th mobilisation wave, using elements of the 8th Infantry Division and the 28th Infantry Division.

The division fought on the Eastern Front, spending much of its existence as part of Ninth Army assigned to Army Group Centre.
In 1943 it was involved in Operation Citadel and its aftermath, losing much of its strength in a series of fierce defensive battles around Orel; by October it was listed as assigned to Second Army and reduced to Kampfgruppe level.
The division had the following organisation in December 1943:

Grenadier-Regiment 84
Grenadier-Regiment 232
Divisions-Gruppe 216
Divisions-Füsilier-Bataillon 102
Artillerie-Regiment 104
Pionier-Bataillon 102
Panzerjäger-Abteilung 102
Aufklärungs-Abteilung 102
Divisions-Nachrichten-Abteilung 102
Divisions-Nachschubführer 102

January 1944 found the division back with Ninth Army, covering its southern flank in the Pripet Marshes.
It avoided the disastrous encirclement and destruction of much of Ninth Army around Bobruisk in late June during the Soviet Operation Bagration, and was then assigned back to Second Army, holding a line of defence along the River Narew.

The Soviet army's East Prussian Offensive, from 13 January 1945 onwards, broke the under-strength division, which was pushed north and trapped in the Heiligenbeil pocket, being reassigned to Fourth Army.
In February it held the perimeter near Mehlsack, before being assigned to defend Braunsberg until it fell on 20 March.
A few troops broke through westwards and eventually surrendered to the Americans in Schleswig-Holstein: the other encircled divisional elements in the kessel were eventually taken over by the 28th Jäger Division, being involved in the final defence of the Kahlholzer Haken peninsula at Balga.

The 102d Infantry Division arrived at Cherbourg, France, 23 September 1944, and, after a short period of training near Valognes, moved to the German-Netherlands border.
On 26 October, elements attached to other divisions entered combat and on 3 November the division assumed responsibility for the sector from the Wurm to Waurichen.
A realignment of sectors and the return of elements placed the 102d in full control of its units for the first time, 24 November 1944, as it prepared for an attack to the Roer.
The attack jumped off, 29 November, and carried the division to the river through Welz, Flossdorf, and Linnich.

After a period of aggressive patrolling along the Roer, 4-19 December, the division took over the XIII Corps sector from the Wurm River, north of the village of Wurm, to Barmen on the south, and trained for river crossing.
On 23 February 1945, the 102d attacked across the Roer, advanced toward Lövenich and Erkelenz, bypassed München-Gladbach, took Krefeld, 3 March, and reached the Rhine.
During March the division was on the defensive along the Rhine, its sector extending from Homburg south to Düsseldorf.
Crossing the river on April 9th on pontoon bridge, the division attacked in the Wesergebirge, meeting stiff opposition.
After 3 days and nights of terrific enemy resistance Wilsede and Hessisch-Oldendorf fell, 12 April 1945, and the 102d pushed on to the Elbe, meeting little resistance.
Breitenfeld fell, 15 April, and the division outposted the Elbe River, 48 miles from Berlin, its advance halted on orders.

The United States Air Force's 102nd Intelligence Wing (102 IW), Massachusetts Air National Guard, is an intelligence unit located at Otis Air National Guard Base, Massachusetts.
It is a parent unit of the 101st Intelligence Squadron.
For most of its history it was a fighter wing for the Massachusetts Air National Guard, and was deployed in areas ranging from France, Panama, to Turkey.
During the September 11, 2001 attacks, the 102nd was the first wing to respond to New York City but it arrived too late to help stop the attacks.
Base downsizing through the BRAC process removed the wing's F-15C Eagles in 2005, leaving the 102nd with an intelligence gathering mission that will be fully active starting in 2010.
It is one of three Air National Guard wings that works with the Air Force Intelligence, Surveillance and Reconnaissance Agency.



After World War I ended, there was a general interest in organizing aviation assets for the National Guard system.
At the time, in the US force structure aircraft were organized into infantry units in a fashion similar to other weapons, like artillery.
Guard units without their own aircraft units would need units from other forces to be sent to operate with them, a situation no-one thought was promising.
The War Department agreed that the Guard should organize aviation squadrons as an organic part of the 18 infantry divisions assigned to the National Guard.

In Massachusetts, the Archie Club, composed of former Army Air Service pilots, lobbied for the formation of an air unit for the Massachusetts National Guard.
The state had been allotted the entire 26th Guard Division.
On June 27, 1921, the Adjutant General of Massachusetts authorized the organization of the 101st Observation Squadron, and within weeks 15 veteran World War I pilots were commissioned and assigned to the 101st under the command of Capt. James K. Knowles.
The 101st built its own air base on land-filled tidal flats at Jeffries Point, East Boston.

The 101 flew its Curtiss JN-4 "Jenny" aircraft throughout New England at air shows, county fairs and other events.
In addition, the 101st attended two-week summer camps that simulated forward deployments.
Pilots flew their Curtiss O-11s to temporary fields on Cape Cod while ground crews followed in trucks.
One of these fields became Cape Cod Airport.
In 1933 Jeffery Field was rebuilt with new hangers and administrative buildings, and renamed Logan Airport in honor of Major General Edward L. Logan, who commanded the 26th Division from 1923 to 1928.

The 101st was ordered into state service in 1936 and 1938 during a devastating flood and hurricane to fly observation missions and to drop food and equipment to stranded fishermen and the residents of Isle au Haut, Maine The 101st helped gained fame when it played a big part in the U.S. Army Air Service's flight around the world.
It then cared for the Spirit of St. Louis when Charles Lindbergh visited the state.


In 1940, the 101st was separated from the 26th Infantry Division and in November was ordered into active Federal service for intensive training.
Initially the 101st’s 25 officers and 133 enlisted men remained at home station until July 31 1941 when it was then moved from Logan to Otis Field at Camp Edwards.
Otis Field was named in after 1st Lt Frank J. Otis, Jr., MD, a 101st flight surgeon who was killed in a flight accident in 1938.
The 101st participated in the North Carolina maneuvers in the fall of 1941 and returned to Otis on December 6 1941.

With the outbreak of World War II, the 101st was assigned to fly anti-submarine patrols off the coast of New England until September 10 1942.
By then many of its original members has been reassigned during the expansion of the Army Air Forces.
During the next two years, the 101st was transferred to several bases and on May 20, 1944 had its mission changed when it was re designated as the 39th Photo Reconnaissance Squadron.
It was then placed under the command of the Ninth Air Force and deployed to the European Theater in December, 1944 with 45 officers and 297 enlisted men.
The 39th flew both P-38s and P-51s during operational missions from January, 1945 to the end of the war in May.
The 39th returned to the states in August, 1945 and was re designated as the 101st Fighter Squadron in May 1946, and then inactivated two month later.

Veterans of the 101st and Army Air Force reorganized the 101st at Logan Airport on July 29, 1946.
The squadron was equipped with the P-47 Thunderbolt and was federally recognized on October 15, 1946.


In the post-war era the National Guard Bureau began a major expansion of the Air units.
Massachusetts was alloted the 67th Fighter Wing, which consisted of the 101st, the 131st Fighter Squadrons, the 202nd Air Service Group, 601st Signal Construction Company, 101st Communications Squadron, 101st Air Control Squadron, 151st Air Control and Warning Group, 567th Air Force Band, 101st Weather Flight and the 1801st Aviation Engineer Company.

With the formation of the US Air Force the Guard units suffered from neglect.
In the midst of the switch to jet fighters, the Guard units were left with their handed-down and generally overused WWII propeller aircraft, and had little money for training.
As the Cold War intensified, the Air Forced looked to the Guard to fill US-based interception missions and started overhauling their organization.
On 1 Nov. 1950 the 67th Fighter Wing was inactivated and replaced by the 102nd Fighter Wing, including just the 101st and 131st along with their associated support units, and assigned to Air Defense Command.
The squadrons were issued F-84Bs, but these aircraft were recalled and replaced by F-51s which were flown until 1954 when the F-94 replaced the Twin Mustangs.
In 1952 the 253d Combat Communications Group was activated and added to the 102nd.

From 1956 to 1976, the 102d was headed by Brigadier General Charles W. Sweeney, who piloted the B-29 Superfortress, which dropped the Fat Man atomic bomb on Nagasaki, Japan in 1945.


During the summer of 1961, as the Berlin Crisis unfolded, several USAF reserve units were notified on August 16 of their pending recall to active duty.
On October 1st, the Massachusetts Air National Guard's 102nd Tactical Fighter Wing and its three squadrons, the 101st Tactical Fighter Squadron, the 131st Tactical Fighter Squadron, and the 138th Tactical Fighter Squadron went on active duty at Otis Air Force Base.

Between the 28th and 30th of October, the 102nd TFW departed Logan International Airport to Phalsbourg, France.
The wing deployed 82 F-86H Sabres.
The 101st's planes were marked with green stripes on their vertical stabilizers, the 131st with red stripes, and the 138th with yellow stripes.
In addition two C-47 Skytrains and six T-33 Shooting Star aircraft were assigned to the wing for support and training purposes.
The 102d's primary mission at the time was to provide close air support to NATO ground forces and air interdiction.
Starting on December 5, the 102nd began deploying to Wheelus Air Base, Libya for gunnery training.

During its time in Europe, the 102nd participated in several USAF and NATO exercises, including a deployment to Leck Air Base, West Germany near the Danish border.
At Leck, ground and support crews from both countries exchanged duties, learning how to perform aircraft maintenance and operational support tasks.

On May 7 1962, the Seventeenth Air Force stated that the 102nd would deploy back to the United States during the summer, returning in July 1962.
Regular USAF personnel, along with a group of ANG personnel who volunteered to remain on active duty formed the 480th Tactical Fighter Squadron of the newly activated 366th Tactical Fighter Wing.


In 1968, the 102nd Tactical Fighter Wing moved to Otis Air Force Base.
The wing flew the F-84F Thunderstreak until June 1971, when a squadron of F-100D Super Sabres was transferred directly from units fighting the Vietnam War.
After making the transition to the "Hun," the Mach 2 F-106 Delta Darts soon arrived to replace them.
On June 10 1972, after completing the move to the F-106, the unit officially became the 102nd Air Defense Wing.
On December 30, 1973, Otis AFB was inactivated and transferred to the Massachusetts ANG as Otis Air National Guard Base.

The wing participated in the interception of Soviet TU-95 Bear bombers on many occasions, the first of which occurred off Long Island in 1975.
Many of these occasions included escorting the aircraft to Cuba.
Other escort missions involved the escorting of drug smuggling planes and the identifying of one mysterious ghost plane, which turned out later to be a weather balloon.

In 1976, the 102nd Fighter Interceptor Group was deactivated and re-formed as the 102nd Fighter Interceptor Wing, assuming authority for the 177th and 125th Fighter Interceptor Groups in Atlantic City, NJ, and Jacksonville, FL, and for the 107th and 147th Fighter Interceptor Groups, flying F-4C at Niagara Falls, NY, and Ellington Field, TX.

The 102nd FIW deactivated its F-106 on January 5, 1988.
Between January and April 1988, the wing converted to the F-15A Eagle and resumed its alert commitment at Otis, and also provided an alert detachment at Loring AFB.
The 102nd was the first ANG unit to be equipped with the F-15.


The wing continued air defense mission after the fall of the Soviet Union.
Examples of this include a 1992 deployment of eight pilots, five F-15 Eagles, and 48 maintenance and security personnel, for five days to Canadian Forces Base Goose Bay, Labrador, Canada.
Another is the humanitarian deployment of 50 personnel from the 102nd Civil Engineering Squadron under field conditions, to the island of Eleuthera in the Bahamas in July 1993.
They helped to rebuild school buildings and municipal facilities that were damaged by Hurricane Andrew.

Between 1991 and 1995 the wing deployed to Panama as part of Operation Coronet Nighthawk, a drug interdiction operation.
From 1995 to 1998 the wing deployed to Iceland for 45 days of air defense duty.
During 1998 members both trained for and performed in real-world contingency assignments in Iceland, Canada, Korea, and Europe.
In 1999 the wing participated in Operation Northern Watch when it deployed with its F-15 Eagle aircraft to Turkey to patrol and enforce the no-fly zone north of the 36th Parallel in northern Iraq.
The wing again deployed more than 350 personnel to the Middle East and Europe in 2000 to participate in Operation Southern Watch.





On September 11, 2001, two planes were hijacked and flown towards New York City.
Then Federal Aviation Administration contacted the North American Aerospace Defense Command's Northeast Air Defense Sector at Rome, New York, bypassing standard procedures.
NORAD ordered the 102nd Fighter Wing to scramble its jets.
Two F-15s piloted by Lieutenant Colonel Timothy Duffy and Major Daniel Nash were scrambled and took off to fly to New York.
Difficulties in pinpointing the exact location of Flight 11 led to a delay of five minutes before the scramble order was given at 8:43.
When Flight 11 hit the North Tower at 8:46, the two F-15 Eagles that had been ordered to scramble were still on the runway at Otis; they did not take to the air until 8:52.
Lacking a target, the F-15s were directed toward military-controlled airspace off the Long Island coast to avoid New York area air traffic.
Uncertain about what to do, the planes were ordered to 'hold as needed' there.
At 9:02, Flight 175 hit the South Tower while the fighters flew to their holding position.
The Northeast Air Defense Sector was not contacted about this hijacked plane until 9:03.
From 9:09 to 9:13 the F-15s stayed in the holding pattern.
At 9:13, the pilots of the F-15s told FAA Boston Center that they were heading for Manhattan to establish a Combat Air Patrol (CAP) over the area.
The F-15s arrived over Manhattan at 9:25.
Duffy later commented, "As we're climbing out, we go supersonic on the way, which is kind of nonstandard for us.
And, and Nasty even called me on the, radio and said, Duff, you're super.
I said yeah, I know.
You know, don't worry about it. ...
I just wanted to get there".


More than 600 wing members were mobilized for Operation Noble Eagle.
The wing began flying around-the-clock combat air patrols missions immediately thereafter, and continued doing so until February 2002.
The wing never deployed overseas to support the wars in Afghanistan and Iraq but it did continue to patrol the Northeastern United States skies.


The BRAC 2005 commission originally planned to close Otis Air National Guard Base and dissolve the 102nd Locals argued that this would leave a huge gap in the national air defenses.
BRAC officials, after visiting the base, decided to keep it open, but the 102nd would still lose its planes, only this time they were only going to the 104th Fighter Wing, based at Barnes Municipal Airport.

The wing hosted its last airshow with the F-15C Eagle at the end of Air Force Week in August, 2007.
The wing shared the last months with the F-15 with the 101st Air Refueling Wing, the 103d Fighter Wing, and the 104th Fighter Wing.
Beginning in 2007, their planes began moving to Barnes Municipal Airport.
With the grounding of the F-15 Eagles, the 158th Fighter Wing, which is based in Vermont temporarily took over the role of patrolling the Northeast's skies.
This interruption of the F-15's flight, coinciding with the transitioning of the fighter jets to the 104th Fighter Wing, created some issues.
The move was originally scheduled to be completed at the end of January, but the grounding of the F-15's in late 2007 and early 2008 delayed this move to the end of February.

On January 24 2008, the 102nd Fighter Wing officially flew its last patrol mission.
The unit's wing commander, Colonel Anthony Schiavi, led the flight, accompanied by Major Daniel Nash, who was one of the first responders for 9/11.
Fire trucks were on hand when the team landed a half-hour later, giving the planes and the pilots the customary ceremonial hose-down for the last time.


As soon as it was announced that the wing would be kept alive and Otis Air National Guard Base would remain open, people began thinking of the future for the 102nd.
There was talk that the wing could transition to an intelligence mission so that it could help support the growing War On Terror.
The plans hit a roadblock when it was announced that there were few funds left with which the wing could use to transition into its new mission.

The new mission was finally confirmed when Governor Deval Patrick announced that the wing would transition to an intelligence mission as soon as the planes left.
Original BRAC plans only said that a Distributed Common Ground Station would be created at Otis.
This didn't include the air guardsmen affected by the loss of their jobs.
The issue was finally resolved when the Air Force announced its plans, right before the F-15's started to leave for Barnes.
On April 1 2008, the 102nd Fighter Wing was re designated as the 102nd Intelligence Wing, with a formal ceremony on April 6.
The wing will reach full operation in 2010.
By October 1st, the wing is expected to be operationally ready.

The Russian 102nd Military Base (Russian: 102-я Российская военная база; Armenian Ռուսական 102-րդ Ռազմական Կայան) is a Russian military base in Gyumri, Armenia, part of the Transcaucasian Group of Forces.
It was formerly the Soviet Army's 127th Motor Rifle Division of the Soviet Seventh Guards Army.
The base is about 120 kilometers (75 miles) north of the Armenian capital, Yerevan.

The 102nd Military Base traces its history to the 261st Rifle Division of the Soviet Union's Red Army.
The 261st Rifle Division was originally formed in 1941.
It was probably activated in the Odessa Military District in July-August 1941.
It was assigned to the 12th Army of the North Caucasus Front later in 1941 and remained with that Army up to at least August 1942 but then was assigned to the Transcaucasian Front's Black Sea Group of Forces.
It then spent much of the later part of World War II, from January 1, 1943, onwards with the small 45th Army of the Transcaucasian Front which was guarding the USSR's borders with Turkey.
After the war ended, the 261st Rifle Division was briefly designated the 37th Rifle Division but then became the 127th Motor Rifle Division in 1965.

61 tanks (Т-72);
130 BMPs (46 БМP-2, 71 БМP-1s, 13 BRM-1Ks);
91 BTRs (85 БТР-70, 6 БТР-60);
12 2S1 self-propelled guns
72 D-30 artillery pieces;
12 РСОЗ BM-21 "Grad"


By the mid-late 1990s the composition of the 127th Motor Rifle Division had changed, following the departure of the majority of the Soviet forces from Armenia.
It consisted of the 123rd, 124th, and 128th Motor Rifle Regiments, the 992nd Artillery Regiment, and the 116th Independent Tank Battalion.
The 123rd Motor Rifle Regiment was formed from the former 164th Motor Rifle Division, also stationed in Armenia.

There are 3,000 Russian soldiers officially reported to be stationed at the 102nd Military Base located in Gyumri.
In early 2005, the 102nd Military Base had 74 tanks, 17 infantry fighting vehicles, 148 armored personnel carriers, 84 artillery pieces, 30 MiG-29 fighters and several batteries of S-300 anti-aircraft missiles.
A great deal of military hardware has been moved to the 102nd Base from the Russian 12th Military Base in Batumi and the Russian 62nd Military Base in Akhalkalaki, Georgia which includes 35 tanks and armored vehicles and 370 pieces of military hardware.
The military base is part of a joint air defense system of the Commonwealth of Independent States (CIS), which was deployed in Armenia in 1995.
Furthermore, the Armenian Air Force relies partially upon the Russian MiG-29s located at the military base, for the defense of Armenia's airspace.

The Russian military base was deployed on the territory of Armenia as early as 1996 (before that, the installation was still known as the 127th MRD of the Soviet Ground Forces).
The bilateral treaty states that the Russian military will be in the base for 25 years, but Armenian authorities have said that if needed this time-frame can be reviewed, and exclusively in the direction of prolongation.
Although Russia does not pay the Armenian government for the military base stationed in Gyumri, the Armenian side takes care of all public utilities water, electricity, etc.

In 1997, Armenia and Russia signed a far-reaching friendship treaty, which calls for mutual assistance in the event of a military threat to either party and allows Russian border guards to patrol Armenia’s frontiers with Turkey and Iran.


The 102nd Regiment United States Colored Troops was an African American infantry unit of the Union Army during the American Civil War.
The unit was organized as the 1st Michigan Colored Volunteer Infantry Regiment before being redesignated as the 102nd Regiment USCT.

The 1st Michigan Colored Infantry was formed on February 23 1863, after an editorial and letter writing campaign by Henry Barns, an editor for the Detroit Tribune and Advertiser.
Barns was commissioned the regiment's first colonel for his efforts; he maintained this post until voluntarily stepping down in favor of a regular army officer.

The regiment was organized at Camp Ward, located on a farm.
Eight-hundred and forty-five men from Detroit, southern Michigan, and Ontario, Canada, volunteered for the regiment.
Some of these volunteers were escaped slaves from the Underground Railroad, and some were fighting to free their family members who may have still been in slavery.
During training, a regimental band was formed which toured to recruit more volunteers.
The regiment also had artillery and cavalry elements.
On May 23 1864, the unit was redesignated the 102nd Regiment United States Colored Troops.

The 102nd Regiment fought throughout South Carolina, eastern Georgia and Florida.
The infantry was assigned to the fort at Port Royal where they served as the second line of defense.
In Baldwin, Florida, 21 miles away from Jacksonville, the unit was attacked suddenly by a Confederate cavalry force.
The soldiers easily defeated the Confederates, which proved to their officers that they were just as skilled and reliable as any other infantry.
In Manchester the regiment and the 54th Massachusetts Volunteer Infantry succeeded in an attack on the flank of Confederate forces, putting them in disorder.
Then the regiment was attacked by 200 Confederates and caused many casualties to the enemy.
The Confederates came to a truce and there Generals Robert E. Lee and Johnson had surrendered; the war was over after that.

This was the regiment's last battle; they served occupation duty until they were called together and were mustered out of service on September 30, 1865.
The regiment returned to Detroit were they were disbanded on October 17 1865.
The total enrollment in the 102nd Regiment was 1446; 6 people were killed in action, 5 people died of wounds, and 129 people died of disease.


Five regiments of the British Army have been numbered the 102nd Regiment of Foot:

102nd Regiment of Foot (Queen's Royal Volunteers), raised in 1760
102nd Regiment of Foot, raised in 1781
102nd Regiment of Foot (Irish Rangers), raised in 1794
102nd Regiment of Foot, originally numbered as the 102nd in 1808 and renumbered as the 100th Foot in 1816
102nd Regiment of Foot (Royal Madras Fusiliers), raised by the East India Company and placed on the British establishment as the 102nd Foot in 1862


The 102nd Regiment of Foot (Royal Madras Fusiliers) was an infantry regiment of the British Army, originally raised by the British East India Company and absorbed by the British Army in 1862.
It was amalgamated with the 103rd Regiment of Foot in 1881 to form the Royal Dublin Fusiliers.


Between the years of 1746 and 1830 the Honorable East India Company European Regiment looked after that organisations interests in British Colonial India.
The regiment was renamed HEIC Madras European Regiment' in 1830, HEIC 1st Madras Europeans in 1839, and HEIC 1st Madras European Fusiliers in 1843.

Between the years 1858 and 1861, following the uprising commonly known as the Indian Mutiny, this HEIC regiment was taken onto the British Army establishment as the 1st Madras European Fusiliers.


On 30 June 1862 Queen Victoria conferred on the Madras European Fusiliers the title of 'Royal' and from this point they became known as the 102nd (Royal Madras Fusiliers) Regiment.

The 102nd were only to last until 1881, when they were combined with the 103rd to become the 1st Battalion Royal Dublin Fusiliers.
The resulting battalion was finally disbanded in 1922 upon the formation of the Irish Free State.


The 102d Signal Battalion provides installation signal support (automation, telecommunications, printing and publications and records management) to the warfighters and organizations within the communities of the 53d and 104th Area Support Groups.


The One Hundred Second United States Congress was a meeting of the legislative branch of the United States federal government, composed of the United States Senate and the United States House of Representatives.
It met in Washington, DC from January 3 1991 to January 3 1993, during the last two years of the administration of U.S. President George H. W. Bush.

The apportionment of seats in this House of Representatives was based on the Twentieth Census of the United States in 1980.
Both chambers had a Democratic majority.


January 3, 1991 – January 3, 1993
First session: January 3, 1991 – January 3, 1992
Second session: January 3, 1992 – October 9, 1992
Previous congress: 101st Congress
Next congress: 103rd Congress


January 1991: First Gulf War

This list is arranged by chamber, then by state.
Senators are listed in order of seniority, and Representatives are listed by district.


Senators are popularly elected statewide every two years, with one-third beginning new six year terms with each Congress.


The names of members of the House of Representatives elected statewide at-large, are preceded by an "At-Large," and the names of those elected from districts, whether plural or single member, are preceded by their district numbers.

Many of the congressional district numbers are linked to articles describing the district itself.
Since the boundaries of the districts have changed often and substantially, the linked article may only describe the district as it exists today, and not as it was at the time of this Congress.

Starting at the North Pole and heading south to the South Pole, the 102nd meridian west passes through:

In the United States, the meridian formed the eastern border of the historic and extralegal Territory of Jefferson.
The eastern border of the Colorado with Nebraska and Kansas lies on the 25th meridian west from Washington, which lies a couple of miles west of the 102nd meridian west.

103 Colmore Row (formerly known as National Westminster House) is a building on Colmore Row, Birmingham, England once owned by Natwest.
It is now owned by the developer British Land who intend to demolish and replace the tower with a 163 metre office skyscraper.


The building was designed by John Madin and is of Brutalist architecture.
The colour scheme is very similar to that of The McLaren Building also in Birmingham.
It is brown and dark green and forms a prominent part of the Birmingham skyline.
It is also one of the newest and tallest buildings in the Colmore Conservation Area, and is a frequent perching point for the city centre's Peregrine Falcons.

Designs for the building were first aired to the public in 1964 and it was remarked that it had drawn inspiration from the University of Pittsburgh by Louis Kahn.
Construction began in 1973 and was completed three years later.
The original metal doors remain with the abstract triangle design, based on the NatWest logo, intact.
The exterior is covered in abstract plaster murals and bronze matt ceramic tiles.
The concrete coffered ceiling is covered in gold leaf.
The lift shaft and two ventilation towers are constructed using brick.
There are four plant floors at the top of the tower and 100 car park spaces in a basement car park that has been left disused upon the discovery of asbestos.

A planning application was submitted to Birmingham City Council in late-2005 for the redevelopment of the tower.
However, this is only a fraction of the entire area scheduled for redevelopment.


The tower was bought by British Land in January 2007.
They announced their intentions to demolish the tower and replace it with another.
Between October 9 and October 11 2007, British Land and Hamilton Architects hosted a public consultation in the banking hall to 103 Colmore Row to showcase the designs for the tower they want to construct on the site.
The proposed office tower will be  tall to the top of a light mast and consist of 28 occupiable office floors and three plant levels.
The tower would be the tallest building in the city, only surpassed by the proposed VTP200.
It will have a roof height of 137 metres.
GVA Grimley have been hired as planning consultants and the project will cost £160 million.

A planning application was submitted to Birmingham City Council on April 29 2008.
The proposed tower was very similar to the design exhibited in October 2007, although the new design had a further four floors of reception and retail space with the Colmore Row elevation consisting of a four storey colonnade.
The light mast will extend from ground level to  above the roof level, giving the building a total height of 160 metres.
As it is proposed to be constructed on the highest ground in the city centre, it will be one of the most prominent buildings on the skyline.
The tower will also have a green roof to act as a natural habitat for protected bird species and will also provide a 30% reduction in energy use.

The building received the backing of the Birmingham Civic Society, however the Victorian Society commented that they were "extremely disappointed" with the proposal.
Savills will market the building.


103 Hera is a large main belt asteroid.
It has a silicate surface composition.
It was discovered by J. C. Watson on September 7, 1868 and named after Hera, queen of the gods in Greek mythology.


103 Search and Rescue Squadron of the Canadian Forces Air Command currently operates the CH-149 Cormorant from CFB Gander, Newfoundland.


103 Search and Rescue Flight was formed at RCAF Station Shearwater on April 1, 1947.
It moved to RCAF Station Greenwood that same year where it remained until three years later when it was renamed 103 Rescue Unit (RU).
While at Greenwood, 103 RU adopted an image of "Albert" (a Saint Bernard rescue dog) for its crest.
103 RU also took on the motto Seek and Save to symbolize its search and rescue role.

103 RU moved to RCAF Station Summerside where it remained until unification of the Canadian Forces in 1968 when it was disbanded.
The remnants of 103 RU formed the new 413 Transport and Rescue Squadron at CFB Summerside.

Canada ratified UNCLOS III (1973-1982) during the mid-1970s and declared a 200 nautical mile Exclusive Economic Zone off its shores in 1977, creating an enormous new area of ocean responsibility for search and rescue.
That year saw the 103 RU reactivated at the strategically situated Gander International Airport to meet the unique search and rescue demands of the western North Atlantic.
Canada has been given responsibility for air/marine SAR operations west of 30ºW and north of 40ºN off the coast of Newfoundland.

At the time of its reactivation, 103 RU was equipped with the CH-113 Labrador twin-rotor helicopter and was stationed in a permanent hangar constructed on the grounds of the airport in 1977 at a Canadian Forces Station named CFS Gander.

During the 1980s, CFS Gander was redesignated a Canadian Forces Base and renamed CFB Gander.
During the 1990s, the primary lodger unit at the base became 9 Wing, with its sole sub-unit being 103 RU.

In March 1997 the 103 RU was granted squadron status and renamed 103 Search and Rescue Squadron.
In June 1997, His Royal Highness, Prince Philip presented the 103 Search and Rescue Squadron with its Standard.


Today, 103 Search and Rescue (SAR) Squadron is charged with providing a 24 hour a day, 365 days a year search and rescue capability to the Halifax Rescue Coordination Centre (RCC).
The Squadron is responsible for a massive area, covering the lower Arctic, the Maritimes, Newfoundland and Labrador and all offshore waters in the region.

Considering that the number of SAR cases in the Newfoundland Region, which are actual distress cases, is twice the national average, 103 Squadron is kept very busy.

Given 103's proximity to major fishing grounds and shipping routes, it isn't surprising that the majority of its missions are marine-based.
SAR crews routinely find vessels in distress, overdue boats and sick or injured seamen.
Crews can easily find themselves nearly 200 miles offshore and with the introduction of Hibernia, a refuelling site at an oil production platform, the potential to go even further out to sea has proven very much a reality.

Outcasts, the name affectionately given to the personnel of 103 Squadron, perform a variety of tasks to keep the Squadron up and running, including flying the helicopters, maintaining and servicing the Aircraft as well as administering and supporting the Squadron.

Its approximately fifty military personnel and twenty-six civilian employees operate three CH-149 Cormorant helicopters.

The CH-149 Cormorant can carry 12 stretchers or a load of 5,000 kg.
Its ice protection system allows it to operate in continuous icing conditions.
The Cormorant routinely conducts rescues that would have been impossible for its predecessor, the CH-113 Labrador.



The different slow motion solo form training sequences of T'ai Chi Ch'uan are the best known manifestation of T'ai Chi for the general public.
In English, they are usually called the hand form or just the form; in Mandarin it is usually called ch'üan: 拳 (in Wade-Giles romanization: ch'üan, in the pinyin system: quán).
They are usually performed slowly by beginners and are designed to promote concentration, condition the body and acquaint students with the inventory of motion techniques for more advanced styles of martial arts training (see pushing hands).


The following is an English translation from Chinese of the form list used by the current Yang family teachers.
Other Yang style schools may have significantly different enumeration schemes.
