1036 Ganymed (pronounced /ˈɡænɨmɛd/) is the largest Amor asteroid.
It was discovered by Walter Baade on October 23, 1924 and is named after Ganymede, the Trojan prince turned god whom Zeus designated the cupbearer to the Greek gods.
Jupiter's moon Ganymede is also named after that individual.

Ganymed is about 32 km in diameter and is an S-type asteroid, meaning that it is relatively reflective and composed of iron- and magnesium-silicates.
It is also a Mars-crosser asteroid.

In 1998, radar observations of Ganymed by the Arecibo radio telescope produced images of the asteroid, revealing a roughly spherical object.

One occultation of a star by Ganymed was observed from California on August 22, 1985.

C103 is a radio station, based in County Cork, Ireland.
It is operated by County Media Limited under a sound broadcasting contract with the Broadcasting Commission of Ireland.
The station is owned by UTV Radio, a subsidiary of Belfast based UTV Media.

It is a dual-franchise with 96FM, also operated by UTV, and itself has two regions - with 8 hours a day of programming regionalised in West Cork.
Frequencies in the 102-103MHz range are used, and the station is streamed online.
The station was originally licenced for the north of County Cork (launched January 1990), but the franchise was subsequently expanded to cover the whole county.
As a dual franchise, the station's sound broadcasting contract (and thus its broadcasting licence) is advertised together with that of 96FM and one company is required to operate the two stations, in a similar situation to that of Shannonside FM and Northern Sound Radio in the northwest of the country.

The station rebranded as C103 in 2008.


Comet Hartley 2, officially designated 103P/Hartley is a small periodic comet with an orbital period of 6.41 years.

Hartley 2 is the object of a planned flyby by the Deep Impact spacecraft on October 11, 2010 as part of the EPOXI mission.


The United States Air Force's 103d Airlift Wing is an Air National Guard airlift unit located at Bradley ANGB, Connecticut.


Before the completion of the BRAC realignment with the 104th Fighter Wing in Massachusetts, the 103 FW provided the firepower of the A-10 for close-air support as well as combat search and rescue missions, while maintaining an expeditionary combat support capability.
In 2005 the Base Realignment and Closure Commission recommended consolidating the wing with the 104th Fighter Wing at Barnes Municipal Airport in Massachusetts, and establish an aircraft maintenance depot at Bradley ANG Base, with no flying mission.
When the BRAC recommendations were announced, Connecticut sued the Defense Department, arguing that the closure of the guard unit without the governor's approval would violate states' rights set forth in the U.S. Constitution.
Before the lawsuit could make it to trial, Connecticut and DoD officials reached a compromise where the A-10s would be transferred to Barnes Municipal Airport, and the 103 FW would transition to flying C-21 learjets, and by 2014 would again transistion to the C-27J Spartans.
As of June 2007, the unit has been reconstituted as the 103d Airlift Wing, according to official advertisements for job vacancies at the wing.

The wing's new mission will be to provide cargo and passenger airlift, medevac, and distinguished visitor support.

103rd (Lancashire Artillery Volunteers) Regiment Royal Artillery provide reinforcements for units using the 105 mm L118 Light Gun and the AS90.
103 Regt RA(V) is equipped with the 105 mm Lt Gun.


The Lancashire Artillery Volunteers were first raised in 1859 as 23 companies of Artillery.
In Manchester some elements had existed as early as 1804 when the Duke of Gloucester inspected the Heaton Artillery Volunteers.
Later on some battalions of the Kings Regiment and the Prince of Wales Volunteers rebadged as Lancashire Gunners.
During the Great War they formed 25 Artillery Brigades or Infantry Battalions and during the Second World War 17 Gunner Regiments.
These Regiments had a particularly distinguished record, winning two Victoria Crosses.
The Bolton Artillery at Serapeum in February 1915, were the first field artillery volunteers in the Great War to fire a shell in anger.
In both World Wars the Regiments served and fought in all theatres.

In 1955 there were 33 Territorial Gunner Regiments in the North West of England.
In 1967 seven Regiments remained and were amalgamated to form 103rd (Lancashire Artillery Volunteers) Light Air Defence Regiment Royal Artillery (Volunteers), The West Lancashire Regiment (T) RA and The South Lancashire Territorials (Prince of Wales Volunteers) RA.
Since its formation in 1967 Officers, Warrant Officers, NCOs and soldiers of 103 Regiment have volunteered and served in support of the Regular Army in Bosnia, Borneo, Belize, Canada, Kosovo, Kenya, Latvia, Iraq, Northern Ireland and Afghanistan.

In 1977 the Regiment changed its designation to 103rd (Lancashire Artillery Volunteers) Air Defence Regiment Royal Artillery (Volunteers) upon being equipped with BLOWPIPE.
Consequent upon the enhancement of the Territorial Army a Battery of Home Service Force and a fourth Air Defence Battery were raised.
In early 1987 the Regiment converted to JAVELIN.
In 1992, as a result of Options for Change, the Regiment lost one Air Defence Battery (213 AD Battery amalgamating with HQ Battery at St Helens), Regimental Headquarters also moved from Deysbrooke Barracks, Liverpool to St Helens to be co-located with 213/HQ Battery.

In 2001 the Regiment was ordered to re-role from Air Defence to Field Artillery as a Light Gun Regiment.
The changes have seen the Light Aid Detachment REME (V) move from Widnes to each Battery having its own REME Fitter Section.
213/HQ Battery has gone into suspended animation, 209 Battery split into 2 Troops, D Troop in Manchester and G Troop in St Helens, and its title is to be 209 (The Manchester and St Helens Artillery) Battery Royal Artillery (Volunteers)


103 Regiment is equipped with the 105mm Light Gun, a versatile, airportable and airmobile artillery piece that can be carried around the battlefield underslung from a Puma or Chinook.
In service since 1975 it has replaced the 105mm Pack Howitzer.

Detachment of 6 personnel, Weight 1,858 kg, Length 8.8m, Width 1.78m, Height 2.13m Ammunition HE, Smoke, Illuminating, Target Marking, Maximum Range (HE) 17.2 km; Anti Tank Range 800m, Muzzle Velocity 709m/s, Shell Weight 5.1 kg, Rate of Fire 6 rounds per minute.


In military terms, 103rd Division or 103rd Infantry Division may refer to:

103rd Infantry Division (German Empire)
103rd Infantry Division (United States)

It is a unit of the Pennsylvania Air National Guard.
Its parent unit is the 111th Fighter Wing.


The 103rd Infantry Division (103. Infanterie-Division) was a unit of the Imperial German Army in World War I. The division was formed on May 3, 1915 and organized over the next few weeks.
It was part of a wave of new infantry divisions formed in the spring of 1915.
The division was disbanded in 1919 during the demobilization of the German Army after World War I.

The division was formed primarily from the excess infantry regiments of existing divisions which were being triangularized.
The division's 205th Infantry Brigade was formerly the 44th Infantry Brigade of the 22nd Infantry Division, and came to the division with the 32nd Infantry Regiment.
The 71st Infantry Regiment came from the 38th Infantry Division and the 116th Reserve Infantry Regiment came from the 25th Reserve Division.
The 32nd and 71st Infantry Regiments were Thuringian units, raised in the Duchy of Saxe-Meiningen, the Principality of Schwarzburg-Sondershausen, and Prussian Thuringia (part of the Prussian Province of Saxony).
The 116th Reserve Infantry Regiment was from the Grand Duchy of Hesse.


The 103rd Infantry Division initially served on the Eastern Front, seeing its first action in the Gorlice-Tarnów Offensive.
It was then transferred south to participate in the Serbian Campaign.
It advanced to the Greek border and remained on the Macedonian front until April 1916.
The division was then sent to the Western Front, entering the line in the Champagne region.
From June to July 1916, it fought in the Battle of Verdun.
In October and November, it fought in the Battle of the Somme, after which it returned to the trenchlines in the Champagne region and by Verdun.
In May 1917, the division fought in the Second Battle of the Aisne, also called the Third Battle of Champagne (and by the Germans, the Double Battle on the Aisne and in the Champagne).
Afterwards, it was in the trenchlines in the Chemin des Dames region and later near St. Quentin and on the Oise River.
In April 1918, the division participated in the German Spring Offensive, fighting in the First Battle of the Somme (1918), also known as the Battle of St. Quentin or the Second Battle of the Somme (to distinguish it from the 1916 battle), and in the Third Battle of the Aisne.
It later fought in the Second Battle of the Marne and the Meuse-Argonne Offensive.
The division remained in the line until the end of the war.
Allied intelligence rated the division as a good division in 1917 but as third class in 1918.

The 103rd Regiment of Foot (Royal Bombay Fusiliers) was an infantry regiment of the British Army from 1862 to 1881, when it was amalgamated into The Royal Dublin Fusiliers.

The regiment was originally raised in England in 1662 as independent companies of European soldiers to garrison Bombay, newly ceded to the British crown, and were transferred to the Honourable East India Company, under the title The Bombay Regiment, when they leased Bombay in 1668.
They were numbered the 1st Bombay (European) Regiment on the foundation of a second European regiment in 1839, and designated the 1st Bombay (European) Fusiliers in 1844.
As with all other "European" units of the Company, they were placed under the command of the Crown in 1858, and formally moved into the British Army in 1862, ranked as the 103rd Foot.

As part of the Cardwell Reforms in 1881, the regiment was amalgamated with the 102nd Regiment of Foot (Royal Madras Fusiliers) to form The Royal Dublin Fusiliers.


103rd Street is a station on the IND Eighth Avenue Line of the New York City Subway.
It is a two level local station with northbound trains using the upper level and southbound trains using the lower level.
There used to be three entrances to this station, but only one of them remains.
This entrance contains one street stair to the mezzanine on the northbound platform with one stair level down to the southbound platform.
Signs to abandoned 102nd and 104th Street exits are covered with red with white “Exit” signs.
The northbound express track runs from the upper to lower level before rising up at 110th Street.


103rd Street is a local station on the IRT Broadway–Seventh Avenue Line of the New York City Subway.
Located at the intersection of 103rd Street and Broadway on the Upper West Side of Manhattan, it is served by the 1 train at all times.

This is the southernmost 3-track station on the line.
South of the station, there are switches that connect the express track to either local track.
However, the express track is currently unused in revenue service.

There is only one exit from each platform, which is placed close to the south end of the platform.
As a result, passengers alighting at this station generally congregate at the front door of the ninth car of a 10-car train traveling uptown, which opens most immediately opposite the platform exit.
On a train traveling south, the equivalent door is the last door of the second car.
Exits from the mezzanine extend to the southeast and southwest corners of 103rd Street and Lexington Avenue.

The station has recently been renovated.
The featured artwork is a 1990 ceramic entitled Nitza, to find it.

The One Hundred Third United States Congress was a meeting of the legislative branch of the United States federal government, composed of the United States Senate and the United States House of Representatives.
It met in Washington, DC from January 3 1993 to January 3 1995, during the first two years of the first administration of U.S. President Bill Clinton.

The apportionment of seats in this House of Representatives was based on the Twenty-first Census of the United States in 1990.
Both chambers had a Democratic majority.


January 3, 1993 – January 3, 1995
First session: January 5, 1993 – November 26, 1993
Second session: January 25, 1994 – December 1, 1994
Previous congress: 102nd Congress
Next congress: 104th Congress


This list is arranged by chamber, then by state.
Senators are listed in order of seniority, and Representatives are listed by district.


Senators are popularly elected statewide every two years, with one-third beginning new six year terms with each Congress.


The names of members of the House of Representatives elected statewide at-large, are preceded by an "At-Large," and the names of those elected from districts, whether plural or single member, are preceded by their district numbers.

Many of the congressional district numbers are linked to articles describing the district itself.
Since the boundaries of the districts have changed often and substantially, the linked article may only describe the district as it exists today, and not as it was at the time of this Congress.

104 is the natural number following 103 and preceding 105.
When written "one hundred four," it is the smallest integer requiring fourteen letters in English.


One hundred four is a primitive semiperfect number and a composite number, with its divisors being 1, 2, 4, 8, 13, 26, 52 and 104.
