104 Company of Syndicalists () was a military unit created by the Union of Polish Syndicalists (Związek Syndykalistów Polskich), which participated in the Warsaw Uprising.


It was formed in Warsaw district of Old Town on August 1, 1944, on the first day of the Uprising, as part of Company Rog of the Northern Group of the Home Army, under Colonel Karol Ziemski (nom de guerre Wachnowski) .

The 104 Company itself was commanded by Lieutenant Kazimierz Puczyński (nom de guerre Wronski), and his deputy was Witold Potz (nom de guerre Koperski).
It consisted of three assault platoons, a reserve platoon, and two labor platoons.
The assault platoons were commanded by the following officers:

1st platoon - commandant Ignacy Choynowski (Rogoza), who died August 3, 1944.
After that, he was replaced by Karol Choynowski (Karol), who was severely wounded on August 11, 1944, and was replaced by an unknown officer (nom de guerre Nord), who died around August 20.
Finally, last commandant of the platoon was Stanislaw Narczyński (Mały),

2nd platoon - commandant Feliks Murawa (Smaga) (seriously sick after August 20, 1944), replaced by Mieczyslaw Teisseyre (Tesc), who was severely wounded on August 27, 1944.
Platoon’s last commandant was Stanisław Komornicki (Nałęcz),

3rd platoon - commandant Jozef Dolegowski (Leśniewski) (died August 28, 1944) and replaced by Wacław Borowski (Ryś).

Also, it had a unit of Military Service of Women, commanded by Maria Oneker, who died on August 22, 1944, and was replaced by Zofia Garnysz-Strzemięczna.



At first, the Company had around 50 soldiers, but it quickly grew in size, with numerous volunteers joining .
On the first day of the Uprising, it took part in two failed attacks on a school located at Barokowa street, in which a German hospital was located.
Also, it attacked the Polish Securities Printing House building, capturing it on the night of August 1/2 .

On the third day of the Uprising, it had some 360 soldiers, who, however, lacked weapons.
The situation improved when the Poles captured Krasiński Palace and seized German guns and grenades as well as 42 German POWs.

The Company was not only engaged in fighting .
It had its own field bakery, which made bread, distributed to civilian population, as well as a field hospital, led by doctor Adam Krakowski.
Furthermore, it had its own press service, consisting of members of the Union of Polish Syndicalists.
It published two magazines - Iskra and Syndykalista.

After heavy fights in the first weeks of August 1944, the Company became the best-equipped Polish unit in the area of the Old Town .
It participated in capture of the PASTA skyscraper and in skirmishes around Warsaw’s Royal Castle.
Then, under pressure from the Germans, it organized defence of the Old Town, including St. John’s Cathedral.

In the second half of August, the Company created its headquarters in the so-called Professors’ House, at 12 Brzozowa Street, where it stayed until general retreat from the district.
During several skirmishes back then, the Company used red-black flags of Anarcho-syndicalists, which was at odds with the Home Army’s Military police, which demanded replacement of the flag with the Polish one and change the name of the Company into 104 Company of the Home Army.
It has been estimated that losses (KIA, MIA and WIA) of the unit reached more than 50% of its personnel .


In late August of 1944 the Company, numbering only around 100 soldiers, evacuated in sewage canals to the mid-city.
There, it became part of the Boncza Battalion, and took place in fighting in the district of Powiśle, during which the Company was depleted.
Assault Platoon with 26 men managed to get to Czerniaków, where it was engaged in heavy fighting.
In early September, parts of the company provided rearguards during the evacuation of Warsaw’s Old Town .

On September 15, 1944, three soldiers managed to get across to the eastern bank of the Vistula, later on more men got across, where they were conscripted to the First Polish Army.


The 104th Infantry Division —nicknamed the Timberwolf Division— is a division of the United States Army that fought for 195 consecutive days during World War II.
Some 34,000 men served with the division under the leadership of General Terry Allen, who was much admired despite his nickname, "Terrible Terry".
The division's first action came in October of 1944 during the taking of Achtmaal and Zundert in Holland.
It then participated in the Battle of the Bulge, advanced through the Siegfried line and across the Inde River into Cologne, and it helped complete the encirclement of the Ruhr pocket.
Finally, it made a 350-mile sweep to the Mulde River in the heart of Germany.
The division was particularly renowned for its night fighting prowess.


The division's nickname came from its timberwolf shoulder insignia.
The division insignia is a gray Timberwolf's head on a balsam green disc.
It was designed by Charles Livingston Bull, artist and authority on wild life, and represents the northwest.
It was in this section of the country that the 104th conducted its training in 1942-43 when it was activated (see U. S. Army Center for Military History - 104th Infantry Division).


From Arno Lasoe's U. S. XIX Corps website:

28 August 1944, Ninth Army, 12th Army Group
5 September 1944, III Corps
15 October 1944, Ninth Army, but attached for operations to the British I Corps, Canadian 1st Army, British 21st Army Group
in clearing the Schelde estuary to open Antwerp ports, during the Battle of the Scheldt
5 November 1944, First Army, 12th Army Group
8 November 1944, VII Corps, First Army
20 December 1944, VII Corps, First Army (attached to the British 21st Army Group), 12th Army Group
21 December 1944, XIX Corps, Ninth Army (attached to the British 21st Army Group), 12th Army Group
3 February 1945, VII Corps, First Army, 12th Army Group


The 104th Infantry Division landed in France on September 7, 1944 .
It is likely that the division was initially involved with implementing the Red Ball Express.


The 104th's first combat experience occurred during the latter portions of the Battle of the Scheldt.
While attached to the Canadian 1st Army, the division moved into defensive positions in the vicinity of Wuustwezel, Belgium, on October 23, 1944, and went over to the offensive on the 25th, taking Zundert and Achtmaal, gaining control of the Breda-Roosendaal Road (see map), and overrunning Vaart Canal defenses.
Leur and Etten fell as the division advanced to the Mark River on October 31.
A coordinated attack over the Mark River at Standaarbuiten (part of Moerdijk municipality), on November 2, 1944, established a bridgehead.
Zevenbergen was captured and the Maas River reached on November 5.


After release by the First Canadian Army, on November 6 the 104th began moving by motor convoy towards Aachen, Germany (see map).
The 414th Regimental Combat Team remained behind temporarily to secure Moerdijk.
On November 8, the division started its relief of the U.S. 1st Infantry Division in the vicinity of Aachen, and it became attached by the VII Corps, First Army.

The 104th participated in the northern edge of what is now called the Battle of Hurtgen Forest.
The abstract of a Defense Technical Information Center report, "Huertgen Forest: Offensive, Deliberate Attack, Forest, 16 November 1944", describes what happened as follows: "The VII (US) Corps, 1st Army attacked 16 November 1944 with 1st Inf Div, 4th Inf Div, 104th Inf Div, and CCR 5th AD to clear Huertgen Forest and the path of 1st Army to the Roer River.
After heavy fighting, primarily by the 4th Infantry Division, VII Corps' attack ground to a halt.
V Corps was committed on 21 November 1944.
Attacking with 8th Inf Div, and CCR 5th AD, the V Corps managed to capture Huertgen after stiff fighting on 28 November 1944."

While the 4th Infantry Division was being stalled by dug-in defenders deep within the Hurtgen Forest, the 104th Infantry Division attacked and secured Stolberg on November 16.
Pushing on against heavy resistance, the 104th division was able to take Eschweiler on the November 21.
The division next cleared the area west of the Inde River, including Inden, in vicious fighting.


Despite strong enemy counterattacks in the vicinity of Lamersdorf, Inden and Lucherberg (see map) in early December, by December 23 the 104th and its attached units had completed a hard-fought, town-by-town drive beyond the Siegfried Line to the Roer River.
From December 15, 1944 to February 22, 1945 (Note: Unit was not in the Battle of the Bulge), the 104th was involved with defending its sector near Düren and Merken (see map).


As the German offensive in the Ardennes wound down, the division moved across the Roer and took Huchem-Stammeln, Birkesdorf, and North Duren.
On March 5, it entered Cologne after heavy fighting (see map).
This archive from the 750th Tank Battalion elaborates on actions involved in the approach to Cologne.


After defending the west bank of the Rhine, the division crossed the river at Honnef on March 22, 1945, and attacked to the east of the Remagen bridgehead.
General Collins’ VII Corps (First Army) was given the assignment of encircling the important Ruhr industrial area of Germany from the south.
Beginning early on March 25, the 3rd Armored Division, with the 104th's 414th Infantry Regiment attached, began a lightning-like thrust eastward.
After 9 days, the 3rd Armored and 414th Infantry had completed a 193-mile dash to Paderborn, and at Lippstadt, they linked up with the U.S. Ninth Army to complete the encirclement of the Ruhr pocket (see map), thus trapping 335,000 German troops.
During this offensive, the 3rd Armored advanced in four columns on more or less parallel roads.
The remainder of the 104th Infantry Division, mounted on trucks and accompanied by the 750th Tank Battalion and other supporting troops, had the job of mopping up enemy forces bypassed by the 3rd Armored.
In many cases, these bypassed forces had recovered from the initial shock by the time the follow-up forces reached them and put up a strong defense.
The 104th repulsed heavy attacks near Medebach, and Paderborn was captured on April 1, 1945.
After regrouping, the 104th advanced to the east and crossed the Weser River on the 8th, blocking enemy exits from the Harz Mountains.

The rapid 3rd Armored advance created an ever-lengthening line for the 104th to defend.
The line was threatened both from German troops on the west attempting to break out of the entrapment and from enemy forces on the east.
There were many engagements all along the line.
Supply vehicles carrying much-needed fuel and other materials were frequently ambushed.
General Collins placed additional divisions in the ever-lengthening line to contain the Germans.
Ultimately there were five infantry divisions, plus a cavalry group, stretched over a 175-mile arc from Remagen to Paderborn.
As the increasing seriousness of the German situation became apparent, larger and larger groups attempted (without success) to break through the American lines.
It was a very fluid situation, and it was uncertain as to when or where the enemy might be encountered (see the 750th records).


After liberating the Mittelbau Dora concentration camp near Nordhausen on April 11 (see The Journey of Private Galione, Supporting Documents), the 104th then crossed the Saale River and took Halle in a bitter 5-day struggle which lasted from April 15 to 19 (see map).
The sector to the Mulde River was cleared by the 21st, and after vigorous patrolling, the division contacted the Red Army at Pretzsch on April 26.
The 104th left for home and inactivation on June 27.

104 Field Battery, Royal Australian Artillery was formed in the town of Moascar in Egypt during March 1916 as the 104th Field Artillery (Howitzer) Battery, part of 4th Field Artillery Brigade.
The battery was disbanded, reformed and rerolled many times during its history and is now inactive.



The 104th Field Battery, Royal Regiment of Australian Artillery, had its beginnings in Egypt, in March 1916.
At this time the Battery was raised as a part of the general expansion of divisional Artillery prior to the AIF going to France.
In mid-March 1916 the battery sailed for France, and upon their arrival were issued with new 4.5 inch howitzers, reunited with their horses and commenced training.
On 21 April 1916, 104th Howitzer Battery relieved C Battery of 176 Brigade Royal Field Artillery (RFA) on the line south east of Armentieres, exchanging guns in the process.
Shortly after this they deployed to Somme and saw their first real action on the Western front.
After the Third Battle of Ypres, the Battery fired in support of the British 30th Division and the British 7th Brigade in the Battle of the Hindenburg Line.

Over the next two years 104th field battery, as part of the 2nd Division Artillery saw intense and unrelenting action on the Western Front, with almost 58% of the total gunners deployed from Australia being killed.
After Victory was declared the Battery returned to Australia and was disbanded.


The battery served two tours of South Vietnam; the first was from May 1968 to May 1969 as part of 12 Field Regiment, supporting 4 RAR.
On returning to Australia, the Battery regrouped in Holsworthy, and moved up to Townsville in preparation for it’s second tour of Vietnam.
The battery’s second tour was from May 1971 to December 1971, again supporting 4 RAR.
104th Field Battery was the last Australian Field Artillery unit to leave Vietnam.
On returning to Australia the Battery was located at Coral Lines Ingleburn with 12th Field Regiment.


For a short period time the Battery participated in peacetime training and support activities, but with the formation of 8th/12th Medium Regiment, the Battery was disbanded in December 1973.
In November 1977 the Battery was re-raised as part of the 8th /12th Medium regiment with 5.5 inch guns.
Soon after the re-raising, the Battery took part in its most important peacetime action.
In February 1978, following a bomb blast at the Hilton Hotel in Sydney, the decision was made to call in the Army to secure Bowral, the venue for the Commonwealth Heads of Government Meeting.
However on 15 June 1979 the Battery was once again formally disbanded.


In October 1985 the battery was re-raised as an Army Reserve Unit, as part of 1st Field Regiment in Brisbane, and again issued with the 105mm M2A2 Howitzer.
The M2A2 was replaced in October 1990, with the 105mm L118/L119 Hamel Gun.

In January 1992 the Regiment converted to the Ready Reserve Scheme, attracting a large increase in numbers to the battery and Regiment.
The scheme involved members undertaking a contract to work full-time for 12 months, then work 50 days a year for the next four years.

In December 1996, the Ready Reserve Scheme was completed, however the Battery continued to foster Ready Reserve Soldiers until 2000, when the Battery assumed the composition that it has today, as a general reserve unit.

104 Field Battery was disbanded on 1 July 2005 during a parade held by 1 Field Regiment to retask 105 Field Battery to a Medium Battery role.
Personnel were transferred to the reserve element of 105 Medium Battery and to other batteries within the regiment.

At the outset of America's involvement in the First World War, the unit was designated the 104th Infantry Regiment for the first time and placed within the command structure of the 26th Infantry Division.
The 104th was the first American regiment to receive the French Croix de Guerre and was described as, "a regiment which fought with such fortitude and courage."
These words henceforth became the unit's motto.


Enemy Storm Troops Hurled Back By Impetuous Yankees

Regiment Reveals Its Valor and Fighting Qualities in the Fierce Combats of Bois Brule.

By AMICO J. BARONE

Apremont!
The name spells horror and glory for the 104th.
In April 1918, the troops from Massachusetts achieved a distinction never before won by American troops in the entire history of our armed forces.
So valorously did they conduct themselves in the Bois Brule, a wood close to Apermont, that the French Government decorated the colors of the regiment with the Croix de Guerre.
It was the first time such an honor had ever come to an American unit.
In addition the regimental commander and 116 other officers and men had the bronze cross with its red and green ribbon pinned on their breasts.
The regimental citation read: "For greatest fighting spirit and self-sacrifice during action of April10, 12 and 13, 1918.
Suffering from heavy bombardments, and attack by very strong German Forces, the regiment succeeded in preventing their dangerous advance, and with greatest energy reconquered, at the point of bayonet, the few ruined trenches which had to be abandoned at the first onset, at the same tome making prisoners".
In a general order issued a few days after the Bois Brule engagements, the French general Passaga declared: "During this fight the American troops gave proof not only of their splendid courage, which we know, but also of a brotherhood in arms which was absolute and ever present.
With such men as these the cause of liberty is sure to triumph."

Continued below: The First American Croix de Guerre to be awarded to an entire regiment.
This Medal was also given to Captain George Roberts, and the bronze frame was specially cast with the infantry tools of the day around the frame.
The frame mold was broke and never reproduced to be one of a kind.
The picture is Colonel George A. Roberts, Commander of the 104th Infantry Westfield Massachusetts.
The 104th is now the 104th Tactical Fighter Wing, Barnes Air National Guard Base.
Westfield MA.

Continued: Bois Brule was in La Reine sector on the southeasterly face of the St. Mihiel salient, a rough and ragged terrain where virtually all the tactical advantage lay with the enemy.
In 1914 the sector had seen violent fighting, but as the war of attrition developed, it became moderately quiet with a sort of tacit understanding between the opposing forces to permit the situation to remain unchanged.
The town of Apremont, whose name will be forever linked up with the 104th Regiment, lay outside the Allied lines.
In the distance, grim and desolate Mont Sec loomed up as a splendid vantage point from which the enemy could observe the American positions.
Difficult Spot to Defend.

The 26th Division took over the sector the first of April, the left of the line being assigned to the 104th.
On the immediate left of the Western Massachusetts outfit was the 10th Colonial French Division.
The regiments sub sector in the Bois Brule formed an awkward, narrow salient, hard to defend.
The trenches were in poor condition, there was inadequate protection against shelling, and the marshy land made trench drainage difficult.
The third battalion of the 104th, under command of Capt. George A. Roberts of Springfield, MA., immediately went into the forward position.
The battalion commander, noting the small salient extending out and realizing how simple it would be for the enemy to pinch in on it and make prisoners of the men holding the position, asked and received permission to straighten out the line.
K Co., under the command of First Lieutenant George Hosmer of Springfield, MA., performed this operation successfully.
For some unaccountable reason, the French had persisted in maintaining the small and unimportant salient and had often lost prisoners to the enemy who would come over and successfully pinch it out.
During the first three of four days the outfit held the sector, it was subjected to a harassing enemy fire.
On April 5th the shelling grew in intensity and for the following four days the area was severely pounded by the enemy artillery.
Evidently, an action was impending and the Germans were bent on shaking the moral of the troops by the concentration of shells.

Early on the morning of the 10th, the enemy blasting became particularly severe.
The huge projectiles from the German minenwerfers came thundering down on the positions held by the third Battalion, shattering trenches and subjecting the men to terrific punishment.
Capt. Roberts sent back word that help was needed to evacuate the wounded and suggested that the bandsmen be used as stretcher bearers.
The suggestion was acted upon and the valiant work these men did under fire won for several of their number decorations from the French and American Governments. ..As the dawn crept over Bois Brule on April 10th, the enemy troops made their appearance on the front held by the 3rd Battalion - a hillcrest.
They came on relentlessly, but that assault wave of storm troops failed to dislodge the men of Western Massachusetts.
It was a severe test of arms in which much technique of warfare was forgotten by the green Yanks who nevertheless battled vigorously and effectively to beat back the veteran enemy.

The artillery fire also was of great aid in stemming that first tide.
Thus for the moment the 3rd Battalion had checked the attack on the night of the 11th despite heavy enemy shelling, the second Battalion came in to relieve the 3rd which had held the position for 10 days.
On the 12th the enemy came over again with renewed energy.
This time the French on the American's left fell back, exposing the left flank of the Yanks.
But the Americans rose to this emergency and by a vigorous counter-attack, driving back remnants of enemy groups.

Gives Credit To Men By the 13th the affair of Bois Brule was over and the 104th had conclusively demonstrated that it could withstand the attack of seasoned troops.
The men had revealed courage and resourcefulness and the officers had shown real leadership under trying conditions.
A day or two later Capt. Roberts was promoted to the rank of major for the splendid manner in which he had handled his battalion.
An incident characteristic of his modesty occurred at that time.
The divisional commander, Gen. Edwards drove up to battalion headquarters and seeing Capt. Roberts he called him over to congratulate him.
Capt. Roberts said: "The credit belongs to the men of the battalion, General, not to me."
The General answered: "You would say that."
On April 28th, the regiment was lined up at Bocq, not far from where it had demonstrated its mettle, and there Gen. Passaga decorated the colors of the outfit and scores of men and officers with the Croix de Guerre.
His voice trembling with emotion, the French officer pinned the red and green ribbons to the 104th colors, saying: "I am proud to decorate the flag of a regiment which has shown such fortitude and courage."

It was a great day for the men of Massachusetts.
Capt. Roberts was among those decorated with the French cross.
He was also recommended for the American Distinguished Serviced Cross.
Later, in the Bouconville sector, he was slightly wounded and in July he was transferred to provost marshal duty in Lanon.

The 104th Military Intelligence Battalion of the United States Army was constituted on September 16, 1980 in the Regular Army as the 104th Military Intelligence Battalion, assigned to the 4th Infantry Division, and activated at Fort Carson, Colorado (the 374th Army Security Agency Company and the 4th Military Intelligence Company concurrently reorganized and redesignated as Companies A and B, 104th MI Battalion).
It inactivated on December 15, 1995 at Fort Carson, Colorado.

The 104th Military Intelligence Battalion rectivated on January 16, 1996 at Fort Hood, Texas.

On December 16, 2004 the 4th Infantry Division formally moved into a new era of organization and effectiveness when it officially became the Army's newest "modular" division.
As a result of the transformation, two battalions and a company cased their colors and no longer serve as active units in the division - the 124th Signal Battalion, the 104th Military Intelligence Battalion and the 4th Military Police Company.
Other units throughout the division absorbed soldiers from those battalions.

The 104th Military Intelligence Battalion was the organic Military Intelligence Battalion of the 4th Infantry Division but is currently retired based on 2005 service restructuring.
The separate companys Alpha, Bravo, Charlie, ACE and HHC are now part of other organizations.
The 104th Military intelligence Battalion under the command of LTC Christman was involved in the capture of Saddam Hussein during the 2003 occupation of Iraq.


The 104th Ohio Volunteer Infantry was an infantry regiment in the Union army during the American Civil War.

Among the nearly one thousand recruits in the 104th OVI was future United States Congressman Laurin D. Woodworth.


The regiment moved to Covington, Kentucky, on September 1, 1862, in preparation for the Defense of Cincinnati against a threatened Confederate invasion by troops under Edmund Kirby Smith.
It was involved in the subsequent Skirmish at Fort Mitchell, Kentucky.

The regiment spent 1863 in Kentucky, and then moved to East Tennessee until April 1864.
It then was reassigned to duty as part of the XXIII Corps in Georgia, Washington D.C., and finally North Carolina.

The 104th OVI mustered out of the army on June 17, 1865.

During its term of service, the regiment had 3 officers and 46 enlisted men killed or mortally wounded in combat.
It also lost 4 officers and 130 enlisted men by disease, for a total of 183 fatalities out of the 1,740 men who served at various times in the regiment.

Five regiments of the British Army have been numbered the 104th Regiment of Foot:

104th Regiment of Foot (King's Volunteers), raised in 1761
104th Regiment of Foot, raised in 1782
104th Regiment of Foot (Royal Manchester Volunteers), raised in 1794

104th Regiment of Foot (Bengal Fusiliers), raised by the East India Company and placed on the British establishment as the 104th Foot in 1862


The 104th Regiment of Foot (Bengal Fusiliers) was an infantry regiment of the British Army from 1862 to 1881, when it was amalgamated into The Royal Munster Fusiliers.

The regiment was originally formed by the Honourable East India Company in 1854 as the 2nd Bengal (European) Light Infantry, and served in the Indian Mutiny of 1857.
As with all other "European" units of the Company, they were placed under the command of the Crown in 1858, and formally moved into the British Army in 1862, ranked as the 104th Foot.

As part of the Cardwell Reforms in 1881, the regiment was amalgamated with the 101st Regiment of Foot (Royal Bengal Fusiliers) to form The Royal Munster Fusiliers.


104th Street is a skip-stop station on the BMT Jamaica Line of the New York City Subway, located on Jamaica Avenue between 102nd and 104th Streets.
The south exit at 102nd Street is closed, but the mezzanine and the stairs to the street and platforms are still present.
The north exit at 104th Street has a clad wooden crossover mezzanine with concrete floor and windscreens half-way up the stairs from the platform.

Until 1966, this station was known as 102nd Street.
It was then given the dual name of 102nd–104th Streets.
As of 2007, station signage and the official map give the station name as 104th Street, but the published timetable gives the name as 104th–102nd Sts.

The 1990 artwork is called Five Points of Observation by Kathleen McCarthy.


104th Street is a station on the IND Fulton Street Line of the New York City Subway, located on Liberty Avenue at 104th Street in Ozone Park, Queens.

The station has three tracks and two side platforms.
The middle track is not currently used in revenue service.
The exit at the northeast end of the station (railroad south) leads to 104th Street.
At the opposite end of the station, there was formerly an exit to 102nd Street, which is now sealed.
Northwest of the station, there is a view of the abandoned LIRR Rockaway Beach Branch tracks from the IND Rockaway Line.

This is one of six stations along Liberty Avenue in Queens that were originally constructed as part of the BMT's portion of the Dual Contracts System.
The stations from 80th Street–Hudson Street to Ozone Park–Lefferts Boulevard opened on September 25, 1915 as an extension of the Fulton Street Elevated Line.
The connection to the BMT was severed on April 26, 1956, with a new connection to the IND Fulton Street Line opening on April 29, 1956.
The Fulton Street Elevated west of Hudson Street was closed, and eventually demolished.

The station has gone by a number of different names.
It opened as Oxford Avenue.
A 1924 system map portrayed the station as "Oxford Avenue", with "104th St." shown below the name in parentheses, and in a smaller print.
By 1948, "Oxford" and "104" were shown in equal sizes, and by 1959 the name was shown as "104 St–Oxford".
The current official map shows the name as just "104 St".
Station signage still shows "104th Street–Oxford Avenue".

105 (one hundred five) is the natural number following 104 and preceding 106.


105 is the double factorial of 7.
105 is a triangular number and a 12-gonal number as well as a sphenic number and a Zeisel number.
It comes in the middle of the prime quadruplet (101, 103, 107, 109).
The only other such odd numbers less than a thousand are 15, 195 and 825.
105 is also a pseudoprime to the prime bases: 13, 29, 41, 43, 71, 83 and 97.
The distinct prime factors of 105 add up to 15, and so do the ones of 104, hence the two numbers form a Ruth-Aaron pair under the first definition.

One hundred five is also a number n for which  is prime, for .
(This even works up to , ignoring the negative sign.)

105 is the sum of the first five square pyramidal numbers.

105 is the smallest integer such that the factorization of  over Q includes coefficients other than .

The 105 mm Howitzer M3 was a U.S. light howitzer designed for use by airborne troops.
The gun utilized a barrel of the 105 mm Howitzer M2, shortened and fitted to a slightly modified split trail carriage of the 75 mm pack howitzer.

The howitzer was used by US Army during the Second World War.
It was issued to airborne units and to cannon companies of infantry regiments.


The process of building airborne forces led in 1941 to a requirement for an air portable 105 mm howitzer.
The weapon, initially designated T7, featured a barrel of 105mm Howitzer M2, shortened by  and combined with recoil system and carriage of the 75 mm field howitzer.
A prototype reached trials at Aberdeen Proving Ground in March 1942.

The howitzer was designed to fire the same ammunition as the longer M2.
It turned out, however, that shorter barrel resulted in incomplete burning of the propelling charge.
The problem could be solved by use of faster burning powder.
Otherwise the design was considered acceptable and was standardized as 105mm Howitzer M3 on Carriage M3.
The carriage was soon succeeded by M3A1, which had trails made from thicker plate.
Even stronger tubular trails were designed, but never reached production.

The production started in February 1943 and continued until May 1944; an additional bunch was produced in April-June 1945.


Even though the M3 was not mentioned in Tables of Organization and Equipment (TO&E) of February 1944, shortly before the Normandy Airdrops some airborne divisions received 105 mm glider field artillery battalion, in addition to three 75 mm howitzer battalions.
1/4 ton jeeps were used as prime movers.
The weapon was finally authorized as an option by the December 1944 TO&E and, by 1945, employed by all airborne divisions in the European Theater.

The M3 was also issued to cannon companies of infantry regiments (six , in three platoons of two).
Infantry typically used 1 1/2 ton truck as prime mover.

A small number of M3 were supplied via lend lease channels to France (94), United Kingdom (2) and countries of Latin America (18).


Gun variants:
T7, standardized as M3.
T10 - variant with elevation improved to 65 degrees.

Carriage variants:
M3 - based on M3A1 carriage for the 75 mm field howitzer.
M3A1 - had stronger trails, made from 1/8 inch plate instead of 3/32 inch.
M3A2 - was fitted with shield.


There were two proposals for a self-propelled artillery piece armed with the M3.
Neither reached mass production.

105 mm Howitzer Motor Carriage T38 - based on the M3 halftrack, never built.
105 mm Howitzer Motor Carriage T82 (M3 in mount M3A1) - based on the Light Tank M5A1 chassis.
Two pilots were built.
The project was cancelled in June 1945 due to lack of requirement.


The gun fired semi-fixed ammunition, similar to the ammunition of the M2; it used the same projectiles and the same 105 mm Cartridge Case M14, but with different propelling charge.
The latter used faster burning powder to avoid incomplete burning; it consisted of base charge and four increments, forming five charges from 1 (the smallest) to 5 (the largest).
Firing M1 HE rounds prepared for the M2 was authorized in an emergency, but only with charges from 1 to 3.
M1 HE rounds for the M3 could be fired from M2 with any charge.

HEAT M67 Shell had non-adjustable propelling charge.
For blank ammunition, a shorter Cartridge Case M15 with black powder charge was used.


105.2 Smooth Radio is a Scottish based Independent Local Radio station broadcasting to Glasgow, and replaced Saga 105.2 FM at 6am on Monday 26 March 2007, launching with John McCauley at Breakfast.
The station competes with BBC Radio 2, aiming its music at listeners aged 50 and over, and is part of the national Smooth Radio network, which encompasses London, the East Midlands, the West Midlands and the North West of England.

As well as being carried on FM in the Glasgow area, the station is also broadcast on DAB digital radio to the East of Scotland and online via a streaming service.


The station came into being following GMG Radio's purchase of the Saga Radio Group in December 2006, and the granting of permission from the regulator Ofcom to change the format of its Smooth FM stations in London and the North West.
The decision was made to change both the Smooth FM and Saga stations to Smooth Radio and Saga 105.2 FM was closed at 6pm on Friday 23 March 2007.
This was then followed by a preview weekend for the new Smooth Radio giving listeners the opportunity to hear the presenters and music which would be featured on the new station.


105.2 Smooth Radio plays middle-of-the-road, adult contemporary music, aimed at listeners aged 50 and over.
It bears very few similarities to its predecessor.
Though many of the presenters who worked on Saga 105.2 FM now host shows on 105.2 Smooth Radio, very few of the specialist shows from the Saga days have survived, and Smooth's initial slogan "Your life.
Your music.", which was used on Saga stations, has now been modified.


Mark Goodier's Mid Morning Show, Tony Blackburn's Weekend Breakfast Show, Andy Peebles' Soul Train and Fiona Phillips' Sunday Afternoon show are simulcast from London and can be heard on several other stations in the Smooth Network.
Evening and overnight shows are also simulcast with some other Smooth stations.
All other output is produced locally.


105.4 Century Radio is an independent local radio station controlled by the GMG Radio as part of its Century Network.
It has a regional license to broadcast to North West England.


The station's launch was the subject of an episode of a BBC Two fly-on-the-wall documentary Trouble at the Top, mainly following Myers.
The episode, entitled "Degsy Rides Again", showed Myers' attempts to train lunchtime phone-in host Derek Hatton, a controversial local ex-politician who had never before presented on radio.
Myers was not confident enough in Hatton for him to appear on pre-launch publicity, although his show "The Degsy Debate" performed well at the first RAJAR.
Also amongst it's launch presenters was controversial shock jock Scottie McClue.

The documentary also covered the station's acquisition of exclusive commentary rights for Manchester United F.C.'s games.
They remained United's official radio partner for almost a decade until losing the rights to Xfm Manchester for the 2007-08 season.

The station was the second Century branded station to launch, the first being Gateshead-based 100-102 Century Radio.
Owned by Border Television, the station was set up by managing director John Myers, who had also established the north east station.
Like the first station, Myers also presented the breakfast show under the pseudonym Morgan.

Myers left the group to head GMG Radio, overseeing the launch of the similar Real Radio brand.
Capital Radio bought the Century network, and was subsequently acquired by GCap Media.
GMG Radio acquired the Century stations in October 2006, reuniting Myers and John Simons (programme director on the original Gateshead station) with the brand.


The station operates from studios in Laser House, an office-building in Salford's Waterside Quay, across the Manchester Ship Canal from Manchester United's stadium and a short distance from fellow GMG regional station 100.4 Smooth Radio.
The building is currently shared with Xfm Manchester.
Former Real Radio and Century Radio breakfast presenter Sarah Carter(nee Graham) is the programme controller

The station's factual production team, headed by head of News James Rea.
105.4 Century Radio also produces two networked shows, High School Days and Disco Divas with Jo Lloyd that is broadcast to Real Radio and 100-102 Century Radio.


Century Radio is the home of the biggest of three GMG radio news "hubs".
The head of news is Christian Spooner, and the group head of news based at Laser House is James Rea.
He heads up 17 journalists.
Bulletins are broadcast on the hour between 10am and 4pm.
And on the half hour between 6am and 10am and 4pm and 6pm.
Extended bulletins are broadcast at 1pm and 5pm.
At night all stations in Northern England within the group( including Century) "opt in" on the hour.
Century Radio's news is shared with Real Radio(Wales/Yorkshire), Smooth Radio(North West/North East) and 100-102 Century Radio.
Sport is broadcast during the extended news bulletins and at 4.30pm and 5.30pm during weekdays.
Century recently won three awards in the 2008 IRN Awards.
Including for Best Scoop, in which they managed to obtain an interview from a witness who saw Rhys Jones get shot dead.


Due to upcoming changes Graham Beecroft now presents the Legends Five Grand Fans, with the Legends asking the questions.
Also Century have announced that the legends will be leaving as from the 2nd august.Other changes include Umberto being reunited with Dave Ward,who he presented a breakfast show with on Piccadilly Magic.
They will host a weekend breakfast show on a Saturday and Sunday.
This means that century will be dropping the talk show, and the future remains in the balance of a football phone in.
With some sources saying that a new host will come in.
And others saying that music will be put in it's place.


Rather than having long term stand- in presenters, Century Radio employ free-lancers to cover when presenters are on holiday

105.7 Smooth Radio is an Independent Local Radio station for the West Midlands of the United Kingdom, and replaced Saga 105.7 FM at 6am on Monday 26 March 2007.
The station competes with BBC Radio 2, aiming its music at listeners aged 35 and over, and is part of the national Smooth Radio network, which encompasses London, the East Midlands, the North West of England and Glasgow.

As well as being carried on FM in the West Midlands, the station is also broadcast on DAB digital radio and online.


The station came into being following GMG Radio's purchase of the Saga Radio Group in December 2006, and the granting of permission from the regulator Ofcom to change the format of its Smooth FM stations in London and the North West.
The decision was made to change both the Smooth FM and Saga stations to Smooth Radio and Saga 105.7 FM was closed at 6pm on Friday 23 March 2007.
This was then followed by a preview weekend for the new Smooth Radio giving listeners the chance to hear the presenters and music which would be on the new station.


105.7 Smooth Radio plays middle-of-the-road, adult contemporary music, aimed at listeners aged 35 and over.
It bears very few similarities to its predecessor.
Though many of the presenters who worked on Saga 105.7 FM now host shows on 105.7 Smooth Radio, very few of the specialist shows from the Saga days have survived, and Smooth's initial slogan "Your life.
Your music.", which was used on Saga stations, has now been modified.


Mark Goodier's Mid Morning Show, Tony Blackburn's Weekend Breakfast Show, Andy Peebles' Soul Train and Fiona Phillips' Sunday Afternoon show are simulcast from London and can be heard on several other stations in the Smooth Network.
Evening and overnight shows are also simulcast with some other Smooth stations.
All other output is produced locally.

"10538 Overture", released in 1972 (see 1972 in music), was the first song to be recorded by Electric Light Orchestra.


The song, written by Jeff Lynne, was intended to be a B-side on one of The Move's singles.
Rick Price of the Move played bass on the track originally but was never credited, apparently with all the overdubs and layers that were added to the track the bass line 'got lost' in the mix and Roy Wood laid down a new bass line.
Roy Wood and Jeff Lynne shared vocal duties on the song much like their previous single California Man, (as The Move).
The song is about a condemned prisoner but Jeff Lynne wanted to give the character in the song a number as opposed to a name when he chanced upon the number 1053 on the mixing desk.
Roy Wood suggested adding number eight to fit the melody better.
The song was still to be a new song by The Move, until Wood added some cello riffs and after many cello layers were added using overdubbing, the 'Overture' and the Electric Light Orchestra were born.
It was during the singles chart run that Roy Wood dramatically exited the ELO line up and returned later in the year with yet another new band called Wizzard.

The song was covered by Bobby Sutcliff and Mitch Easter in 2001, by Parthenon Huxley in 2005 and by Def Leppard in 2006.

In March 2007 the song was used in the closing credits of an episode of Life on Mars.

An almost identical opening riff can be heard in the song "The Changingman" by Paul Weller, which also seems to recreate the beginning of "In Old England Town (instrumental) from the b side of the single Showdown in the UK.


"10538 Overture was an idea that Jeff (Lynne) brought along to the studio which was originally to be a Move track.
After recording the basic backing track, the other guys went home, leaving Jeff and myself to run riot with the overdubs.
At the time, I was very keen on collecting instruments, and had just acquired a cheap Chinese cello.
After we had finished overdubbing the guitars, I sat in the control room trying out this cello and sort of messing around with Jimi Hendrix type riffs.
Jeff said, 'That sounds great, why don't we throw it on the track.'
I ended up recording around fifteen of these, and as the instrumentation built up, it was beginning to sound like some monster heavy metal orchestra.
In fact, it sounded just Bloody Marvellous."

– 

I had this guitar track, like a real big riff on a guitar.
I laid it down in the studio and Roy Wood got his cello, his Chinese cello, and he overdubbed about fifteen cello riffs, just double tracking all the time-- and it sounded fantastic.
We thought, it was like 'Wow!' and we just sat round playing it for days.

10538 Torode (1991 VP2) is a Main-belt Asteroid discovered on November 11, 1991 by B. G. W. Manning at Stakenbridge.



February — Battle of Mortemer: The Normans defeat a French army as it is caught pillaging and plundering.
King Henry I of France withdraws his main army from Normandy as a result.
April 30, Rosdalla Ireland: Earliest known European tornado.
July 4 — The SN 1054 supernova is recorded by the Chinese, Arab and possibly Native Americans near the star ζ Tauri.
For 23 days it remains bright enough to be seen in daylight.
Its remnants form the Crab Nebula (NGC 1952).
July 16 - Cardinal Humbertus, a representative of Pope Leo IX, and Michael Cerularius, Patriarch of Constantinople, decree each other's excommunication.
Most historians look to this act as the final step in the initiation of the Great Schism between the Roman Catholic and Orthodox Christian Churches.
In 1965, those excommunications are rescinded by Pope Paul VI and Patriarch Athenagoras when they meet in the Second Vatican Council.
However, to this day each church claims to be the One Holy Catholic and Apostolic Church and each denies the other's right to that name.
July 27 - Siward, Earl of Northumbria invades Scotland to support Malcolm Canmore against Macbeth, who usurped the Scottish throne from Malcolm's father, King Duncan.
Macbeth is defeated at Dunsinane.
