before 2004 the contribution of the country coefficient was 50% .
bare alumina ( η ≈ 1.77 , " k " ≈ 10 −6 ) has a negligible extinction coefficient and reflects only 8% of the incident light from the microscope .
the temperature coefficient of energy divided by a substance - like quantity ( amount of substance , mass , volume ) describing the sample .
both representations follow easily from parseval 's theorem and the fact that differentiation is equivalent to multiplying the fourier coefficient by " in " .
therefore a coefficient must be determined to convert apparent depth changes to true depth changes .
even though , theoretically , it seems as if m can increase without limit ( exponentially ) , physically , it is limited to about m < 108 or αx < 20 ( where α is the first townsend coefficient and x is the length of the path of ionization , starting from the point of the primary ionization .
the league coefficient is used to rank the leagues of europe , and thus determine the number of clubs from a league that will participate in uefa champions league and uefa europa league .
income inequality , measured by the gini coefficient is how evenly incomes are distributed through the population .
most dry materials in combination have friction coefficient values between 0.3 and 0.6 .
reactors in which either the moderator or the coolant is a liquid typically will have a void coefficient value that is either negative ( if the reactor is under - moderated ) or positive ( if the reactor is over - moderated ) .
complementary to " r " is the " transmission coefficient " or " transmittance " , " t " .
its resistivity is high enough to achieve suitable resistance values in even very small grids , and its temperature coefficient of resistance is not excessive .
when various barriers and restricting factors such as cell membranes and microtubules interfere with the free diffusion , we are measuring an " apparent diffusion coefficient " or adc because the measurement misses all the local effects and treats it as if all the movement rates were solely due to brownian motion .
the c6 comes close to retaining the relatively good fuel economy of the c5 , due in part to its relatively low.28 drag coefficient and low curb weight , achieving 16/26 mpg ( city / highway ) when equipped with an automatic transmission .
as phase values can only vary from zero to 2π , then repeat in either direction ( termed phase wrapping ) , changing the piston coefficient changes the zero phase value contour locations across the wavefront .
the multiplicity of " w'k " at class(d ) is the binomial coefficient
in 1929 , national advisory committee for aeronautics ( naca ) investigations found that the upper wing carried a higher lift coefficient than the lower wing — at high speeds it could be 2.55 times as much .
for approximately gaussian data , the sampling distribution of pearson 's correlation coefficient approximately follows student 's t - distribution with degrees of freedom " n " − 2 .
such reactors would be described as fitted with such a " passive safety " component that could - if so designed - render in a reactor a negative void coefficient of reactivity , regardless of the operational property of the reactor in which it is fitted .
