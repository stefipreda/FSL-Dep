early advances included the nation 's first self - contained facility for treating children with active cases of tb , work on anti - tb drugs such as isoniazid ( inh ) , and the use of microbiological assay measurements to determine the proper dosage of inh in the 1950s .
also known as a " genotypic assay " , techniques include pcr , dna fragment analysis , allele specific oligonucleotide ( aso ) probes , dna sequencing , and nucleic acid hybridization to dna microarrays or beads .
therefore , prior to starting a large screen , smaller test ( or pilot ) screens are used to assess the quality of an assay , in an attempt to predict if it would be useful in a high - throughput setting .

depending on the pharmacological assay the half maximal inhibitory concentration ic50 is in the nanomolar to low micromolar range .
the technique relies upon the properties of two restriction enzymes : " hpa"ii and " msp"i. the help assay compares representations generated by " hpa"ii and by " msp"i digestion of the genome followed by ligation - mediated pcr . "
