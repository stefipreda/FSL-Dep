a fibreglass tank was built around her , and she was immersed in sodium carbonate solution from 1995 .
oolite is a sedimentary rock composed of small spherical grains of concentrically layered carbonate that may include localized concentrations of fossil shells and coral .
the cretaceous as a separate period was first defined by a belgian geologist jean d'omalius d'halloy in 1822 , using strata in the paris basin and named for the extensive beds of chalk ( calcium carbonate deposited by the shells of marine invertebrates , principally coccoliths ) , found in the upper cretaceous of western europe .
smalt is produced by melting a mixture of the roasted mineral smaltite , quartz and potassium carbonate , yielding a dark blue silicate glass which is grinded after the production .
black also found that when bubbled through an aqueous solution of lime ( calcium hydroxide ) , it would precipitate calcium carbonate .
soda - lime phosphosilicate glasses also form the basis for bioactive glasses ( e.g. bioglass ) , a family of materials which chemically convert to mineralised bone ( hydroxy - carbonate - apatite ) in physiological fluid .
they are also unusual in that they may use hartshorn ( ammonium carbonate , or baker 's ammonia ) as a leavening agent , though many recipes omit it in favour of modern leavening agents .
