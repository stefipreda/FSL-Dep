thus , one can regard a finite vector space as a " q "- generalization of a set , and the subspaces as the " q "- generalization of the subsets of the set .
for any triad of spaces ( " x";"a","b " ) ( i.e. space " x " and subspaces " a","b " ) and integer " k " > 2 there exists a homomorphism
a " multiresolution analysis " of the space formula_1 consists of a sequence of nested subspaces
so the union of these subspaces can be identified with the wedge sum " x " ∨ " y " .
in terms of euclidean subspaces , the orthogonal complement of a line is the plane perpendicular to it , and vice versa .
the invariant subspaces of φ are precisely the left ideals of " a " .
the gaussian coefficients count subspaces of a finite vector space .
let " x " be a topological space and let " c " = be a family of subspaces of " x " ( typically " c " will be a cover of " x " ) .
it is the set of all those subspaces of the vector space " f " " n " that are generated by subsets of the set " e " that consists of vectors with at most two nonzero coordinates .
the sullivan algebra is called minimal if the image of " d " is contained in λ+("v")2 , where λ+("v " ) is the direct sum of the positive degree subspaces of λ("v " ) .
in infinite - dimensional hilbert spaces , some subspaces are not closed , but all orthogonal complements are closed .
the fibers of the product are linear subspaces .
these subspaces are invariant under " t " .
if whenever a topological space has a certain topological property we have that all of its subspaces share the same property , then we say the topological property is hereditary .
often , subspaces which do not satisfy this containment criterion still can be excised —
these correlations are substantially uniform across the entire code space , resulting in each code subspace contributing interference to all of the other code subspaces .
the use of mapping cylinders is to apply theorems concerning subspaces or inclusions of spaces to general maps which may not be injective .
in higher dimensional spaces there are considered hyperplanes ( which always meet ) , and other linear subspaces , which exhibit the principle of duality .
it has a natural projection " p" : graff"k"("v " ) → gr"k"("v " ) , the grassmannian of all linear " k "- dimensional subspaces of " v " by defining " p"("u " ) to be the translation of " u " to a subspace through the origin .
the terminology projective line is appropriate , because the points are in 1 - 1 correspondence with one - dimensional linear subspaces of r2 .
