west valley reprocessing plant .
the purpose of reprocessing in the ifr fuel cycle is simply to reduce the level of those fission products that are neutron poisons ; even those need not be completely removed .
black diesel is created by reprocessing waste motor oil , hydraulic oil , and transmission fluids .
nirs is opposed ineffective nuclear waste reprocessing , unsafe transportation of nuclear waste , and the implementation of large - scale nuclear dumps like yucca mountain .
as it is normal to allow used nuclear fuel to stand for about five years before reprocessing , much of this activity will decay away leaving 4.7 mbq of 102rh and 5.0 mbq of 102mrh .
the spent uranium and the uranium left when operation was discontinued were transported to bnfl in sellafield for nuclear reprocessing .
in 1956 the french agreed to secretly build the dimona nuclear reactor in israel and soon after agreed to construct a reprocessing plant for the extraction of plutonium at the site .
note that while the vast majority of the uranium is removed by purex nuclear reprocessing , a small amount of uranium is left in the raffinate from the first cycle of the purex process .
the iraqi government had tried and failed in 1974 to buy a french gas - graphite plutonium producing reactor and a reprocessing plant , and they had also failed in an attempt to buy an italian " cirene " reactor .
hence , plutonium separation takes place in campaigns . reprocessing ( also known as separation )
for a power reactor such a large reprocessing facility is currently deemed uneconomic .
later , black chaired the uk government investigation into childhood leukaemia around the nuclear reprocessing plant at sellafield , cumbria , uk .
she participated in greenpeace protests against the sellafield reprocessing plant and narrated black wind white land , an irish film which highlighted the plight of victims of the chernobyl nuclear disaster .
in may , 2006 an international awareness campaign about the dangers of the rokkasho reprocessing plant , stop rokkasho , was launched by musician ryuichi sakamoto .
eye movement desensitization and reprocessing ( emdr ) is specifically targeted as a treatment for ptsd .
some clinicians include the mind 's ability to spontaneously generate imagery that can provide intuitive solutions or even reprocessing that improves people typical reactions to situations or inner material .
the necessary reprocessing technology , which has to process the complete fuel every 10 days , has only been demonstrated at laboratory scale .
this self - sufficiency extends from uranium exploration and mining through fuel fabrication , heavy water production , reactor design and construction , to reprocessing and waste management .
greenpeace has consistently opposed the use of nuclear power , and has been campaigning since 1997 for the shutdown of la hague reprocessing site .

three decades ago , the u.s. government opposed civilian nuclear reprocessing because of nuclear proliferation dangers .
steel exports to the united states were also curtailed , but the problems continued as disputes flared over united states restrictions on japanese development of nuclear fuel- reprocessing facilities , japanese restrictions on certain agricultural imports , such as beef and oranges , and liberalization of capital investment and government procurement within japan .
on october 21 , 2003 , in tehran , the iranian government and eu-3 foreign ministers issued a statement known as the tehran declaration in which iran agreed to co - operate with the iaea , to sign and implement an additional protocol as a voluntary , confidence - building measure , and to suspend its enrichment and reprocessing activities during the course of the negotiations .
reprocessing can potentially recover up to 95% of the remaining uranium and plutonium in spent nuclear fuel , putting it into new mixed oxide fuel .
while it is possible to extract the plutonium , international monitoring of a closed system is claimed to be much easier than one that has external reprocessing .
the general plan provides for snf transportation to russia for reprocessing .
nuclear reprocessing is useful economically because chemical separation is much simpler to accomplish than the difficult isotope separation required to prepare nuclear fuel from natural uranium ore , so that in principle chemical separation yields more generated energy for less effort than mining , purifying , and isotopically separating new uranium ore .
assuming the price of uranium rose making reprocessing economically viable , plants would be built .
