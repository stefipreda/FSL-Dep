anaya is also remembered for commutation of death sentences of all eight death row inmates in new mexico in 1986 , due to his opposition to capital punishment .
the operators " p " , " q " satisfy the commutation relation
the total angular momentum satisfies the same commutation relations as angular momentum , namely
in the situation of the standard position - momentum commutation ( in which the uncertainty principle is most known ) , this implies that a fixed , finite , volume of space has an infinite capacity to store information .
wilson harshly criticized president george w. bush 's july 2 , 2007 commutation of lewis libby 's prison sentence , calling it " a cover - up of the vice president 's role in this matter and quite possibly the role of the president and/or some of his senior white house advisers . "
trying to represent the commutation relations .
according to laud he held out to strafford hopes of saving his life if he would use his influence with the king to abolish episcopacy , but the earl refused , and holles advised charles that strafford should demand a short respite , of which he would take advantage to procure a commutation of the death sentence .
commutation act .
this is often done through commutation tests .
a brushless dc ( bldc ) motor is a synchronous electric motor powered by direct - current ( dc ) electricity and having an electronic commutation system , rather than a mechanical commutator and brushes .
compared to the other power semiconductor devices ( igbt , thyristor ... ) , its main advantages are high commutation speed and good efficiency at low voltages .
all such nontrivial commutation relations for pairs of operators lead to corresponding uncertainty relations ( h. p. robertson ) , involving positive semi - definite expectation contributions by their respective commutators and anticommutators .
parker pillsbury also used the pages of a prominent newspaper , the semi - weekly republican as well as " the liberator " to plead for commutation of goode 's sentence .
hillary clinton in her campaign for senator also criticised the commutation , although she had earlier been supportive .
the commutation cell in converters .
by repeatedly applying the commutation relations it takes a lot of work , as you can see , to express formula_40 in the form of a sum of normally ordered products .
to make this rigorous requires a sensible discussion of the limiting space of functions , and in this space this is the stone - von neumann theorem--- any operators x and p which obey the commutation relations can be made to act on a space of wavefunctions , with p a derivative operator .
gbm-700 type electric engines used in ew90 , ew91 and ew92 units have 4 main poles and 4 commutation poles .
others , notably cheney himself who argued that libby was unfairly charged by a politically - motivated prosecution , believed that the commutation fell short , as libby would likely never practice law again .
from the commutation relations the possible eigenvalues can be found .
