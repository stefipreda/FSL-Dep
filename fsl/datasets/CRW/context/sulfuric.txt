venus was never quite so popular as mars , probably because it obdurately refused to display any surface features ( it is covered with sulfuric acid clouds only dimly translucent to visible light ) , making any statement about its nature disturbingly speculative .
a barrier layer of nickel is usually deposited on silver first , though in this case it is not to prevent migration of silver through rhodium , but to prevent contamination of the rhodium bath with silver and copper , which slightly dissolve in the sulfuric acid usually present in the bath composition .
the primary contaminants at the site were sulfuric acid , hydrogen sulfide , sulfur dioxide , and heavy metals .
the most commonly used set of reagents is sulfuric acid ( h2so4 ) and mercury(ii ) sulfate ( hgso4 ) .
in the roasting process , sulfuric acid is formed and acts on the clay to form aluminium sulfate , a similar condition of affairs being produced during weathering .
if the coal is strip mined , the entire exposed seam leaches sulfuric acid , leaving the subsoil infertile on the surface and begins to pollute streams by acidifying and killing fish , plants , and aquatic animals which are sensitive to drastic ph shifts .
in another series of studies the powerful reagent obtained by using a mixture of iodine and potassium iodate dissolved in concentrated sulfuric acid was used .
when this layer is penetrated by acids such as hydrochloric acid and sulfuric acid the reaction proceeds with the evolution of hydrogen gas .
in 1812 he became the first person to convert starch into a sugar ( corn syrup ) , by heating it with sulfuric acid .
sulfuric acid production .
sulfur dioxide and water vapor rise on convection currents from the mid - level atmospheric layers to higher altitudes , where they will be transformed again into sulfuric acid , and the cycle repeats .
if sulfuric acid is used , significant volumes are needed .
this results in the formation of sulfuric acid and bilinite ( keith , et al . , 2001 ) .
tantalum is inert against most acids except hydrofluoric acid and hot sulfuric acid , also hot alkaline solutions cause tantalum to corrode .
after the eruption , there has been a constant flow of sulfuric gas coming from mount oyama ( see link ) .
superphosphate of lime is a mixture of two phosphate salts , calcium dihydrogen phosphate ca(h2po4)2 and calcium sulfate dihydrate caso4•2h2o produced by the reaction of sulfuric acid and water with calcium phosphate .
for example , in copper refining , copper anodes , an intermediate product from the furnaces , are electrolysed in an appropriate solution ( such as sulfuric acid ) to yield high purity ( 99.99% ) cathodes .
thus , it forms barium sulfate and barium phosphate with sulfuric and phosphoric acids , respectively .
acids are used as catalysts ; for example , sulfuric acid is used in very large quantities in the alkylation process to produce gasoline .
sulfur is used for manufacturing sulfuric acid , medicine , cosmetics , fertilizers and rubber products .
it was first synthesized in 1540 by valerius cordus , who called it " sweet oil of vitriol " ( " oleum dulce vitrioli " ) — the name reflects the fact that it is obtained by distilling a mixture of ethanol and sulfuric acid ( then known as oil of vitriol)—and noted some of its medicinal properties .
oleum is a useful form for transporting sulfuric acid compounds , typically in rail tankcars , between oil refineries ( which produce various sulfur compounds as a byproduct of refining ) and industrial consumers .
in the case of oxide copper ore , a heap leaching pad will dissolve a dilute copper sulfate solution in a weak sulfuric acid solution .
rates of consumption for hf acid in alkylation plants are much lower than for sulfuric acid .
