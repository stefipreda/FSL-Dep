in fact , a standard probability space formula_59 is countably separated if and only if the cardinality of formula_135 does not exceed continuum ( see ) .
given a bipartite graph " g " = ( " x"∪"y " , " e " ) , we are to find a maximum cardinality matching in " g " , that is a matching that contains the largest possible number of edges .
let us assume a set of entities each having the same formula_36 features , i.e. , feature set formula_2 , with each feature variable having cardinality formula_38 .
thus , by lagrange 's theorem , finding a unique formula_51 lying in this interval and satisfying formula_52 , results in finding the cardinality of formula_1 .
since cardinality is such a common concept in mathematics , a variety of names are in use .
poor cardinality estimates and uncaught correlation are one of the main reasons why query optimizers pick poor query plans .
for instance , since " ℓ"2("b " ) has an orthonormal basis indexed by " b " , its hilbert dimension is the cardinality of " b " ( which may be a finite integer , or a countable or uncountable cardinal number ) .
are of equal cardinality ( using the same restrictions as before on " i " and " n " ) .
indexed by infinite cardinals whose elements fix all but a certain cardinality of elements of the set .
where a is some set with cardinality formula_170 .
the cardinality of a set " a " is usually denoted | " a " | , with a vertical bar on each side ; this is the same notation as absolute value and the meaning depends on context .
a set is a singleton if and only if its cardinality is .
we conclude that [ 0,1 ] and [ 0,1]×[0,1 ] have the same cardinality .
morley proved that if i(t,ℵ0 ) is infinite then it must be ℵ0 or ℵ1 or the cardinality of the continuum .
be the cardinality of any countably infinite set ; for concreteness , take the set formula_5 of natural numbers to be a typical case .
for instance , the set of real numbers has greater cardinality than the set of natural numbers .
an example is deciding if an " n "- vertex graph contains an independent set of cardinality " k " .
the rank of a finitely generated group " g " can be equivalently defined as the smallest cardinality of a set " x " such that there exists an onto homomorphism " f"("x " ) → " g " , where " f"("x " ) is the free group with free basis " x " .
moreover , if mapping goes from one set to a set of the same cardinality , it should be bijective .
the cardinality of the set formula_6 is formula_7 .
as cantor realized , this collection could not itself have a cardinality , as this would lead to a paradox of the burali - forti type .
this implies that the quadratic irrationals have the same cardinality as ordered quadruples of integers , and are therefore countable .
y. girard to model linear logic [ 3 ] ) , while chu spaces over " k " realize any category of vector spaces over a field whose cardinality is at most that of " k " .
in his defense , cantor himself pointed out that bolzano worked in a time when the concept of the cardinality of a set was absent .
examples of his results in applications to algebra include the finding that under the weak continuum hypothesis there is no universal object in the class of uncountable locally finite groups ( answering a question of macintyre and shelah ) ; with shelah , showing that there is a jump in cardinality of the abelian group extp("g " , " z " ) at the first singular strong limit cardinal ; and , with shelah , eliminating the use of the diamond in the proof of existence theorem for complete universal locally finite groups in several cardinalities .
one of cantor 's most important results was that the cardinality of the continuum ( c ) is greater than that of the natural numbers ( 0 ) ; that is , there are more real numbers r than whole numbers n.
